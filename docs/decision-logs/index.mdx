# Introduction

Decision logs are records of authorization decisions Topaz makes. Decisions are made by the Topaz [is](/docs/authorizer-guide/is) API,
each decision generates one log entry and each log entry has details about the decision including the context in which it was made.

# Configuration

Topaz decision logs are implemented as an OPA plugin and can be configured in the [Topaz configuration file](/docs/command-line-interface/topaz-cli/configuration)
by adding the plugin to the OPA runtime's configuration. For example, this adds to the default configuration generated by the Topaz CLI:

```yaml

opa:
  instance_id: "-"
  graceful_shutdown_period_seconds: 2
  local_bundles:
    paths: []
    skip_verification: true
  config:
    services:
      ghcr:
        url: https://ghcr.io/
        type: "oci"
        response_header_timeout_seconds: 5
    bundles:
      todo:
        service: ghcr
        resource: "ghcr.io/aserto-policies/policy-todo:latest"
        persist: false
        config:
          polling:
            min_delay_seconds: 60
            max_delay_seconds: 120
    // Add the decision logging plugin to the OPA runtime
    plugins:
      aserto_decision_log:
        enabled: true

// Configure the file logger the plugin will log to
decision_logger:
  type: "file"
  config:
    log_file_path: /tmp/topaz/decisions.log
    max_file_size_mb: 20
    max_file_count: 3
```
