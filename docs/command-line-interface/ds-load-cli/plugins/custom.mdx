# Writing a custom plugin

Plugins have a simple contract with the host `ds-load` command. They can be written in any language.

A set of go packages can be used as a "mini-SDK" for building custom plugins in go. This eliminates much of the "boilerplate" of writing a plugin, including commands like `export-transform`, providing help, and so on.

The plugins that come with `ds-load` can all be found [here](https://github.com/aserto-dev/ds-load/tree/main/plugins). They can be used as a guide for how to write a custom plugin for a new data source.

In addition, a standalone plugin for importing Hubspot data into the directory can be found [here](https://github.com/aserto-demo/ds-load-hubspot). This shows how to properly import the `ds-load` SDK in an external plugin.

## Retrieving data

Most of the "heavy lifting" of building a plugin involves retrieving data from the source. The Hubspot plugin uses the Hubspot REST API, and can easily be adapted to any other service that supports a REST interaction pattern.

## Transforming into objects and relations

The other main task is to author the default transform for the plugin. The [transformation](/docs/command-line-interface/ds-load-cli/transform.mdx) docs provide an annotated walkthrough of the Auth0 default transform, which can act as a guide.

The Hubspot sample plugin also has a default transform that shows how to create objects of different types, and relationships between them.

## Installation

To have `ds-load` pick up your custom plugin, simply call it `ds-load-<plugin-name>` and copy the binary to `~/.ds-load/plugins`.

```sh
ls -l ~/.ds-load/plugins
total 32000
-rwxr-xr-x  1 ogazitt  staff    16M Aug  3 10:50 ds-load-hubspot*```
```

To verify that `ds-load` can load your plugin, use `ds-load exec --help`. Note that `hubspot` is in the list of available commands:

```sh
Usage: ds-load exec <command> ...

import data in directory by running fetch, transform and publish

Arguments:
  <command> ...    available commands are: hubspot|auth0|azuread|cognito|google|okta
```

## Need help?

Please drop us a line in our [community slack](https://aserto.com/slack) if you need help writing a custom plugin!  Also, we're happy to evaluate and accept new providers written by the community via a Pull Request in the [ds-load](https://github.com/aserto-dev/ds-load) repository.

Submitted plugins should follow the same design patterns as existing providers, and live in the [plugins](https://github.com/aserto-dev/ds-load/tree/main/plugins) directory.
