# Register to OPCR

In order to register policy images with [Open Container Registry](https://www.openpolicyregistry.io/), using the `policy` CLI, you'll have to create an OPCR account.

## Create an account

Click the `Sign in` button in the top right of the navbar, or go to [console.openpolicyregistry.io](https://console.openpolicyregistry.io), and create an `opcr.io` account with your GitHub account. This will trigger
GitHub's OAuth2 flow.

:::note
Since OPCR uses GitHub as its identity provider, your account will be named after your GitHub account.

### Organizations

Much like with GitHub or Docker, an organization name provides the first part of a two-part name
for a policy repository. For example, if your organization is named `foo`, you are able to create
a repository named `foo/bar`.

### Naming your personal organization

The first time through, you will be asked to name your organization. You can use your GitHub account name, or choose a different organization name that is unused, and passes the account naming conventions (4 or more characters, no profanity).

:::warning
Choose your organization name carefully - you cannot change it later.

:::note
Currently, only personal organizations are supported. In the future, you'll be able to create
organizations that have multiple members, similar to GitHub and Docker.

## Repositories and Images

Repositories live under organizations.

### Policy repositories

A policy repository is identified using a two-part naming scheme: `org-name/repo-name`.

### Policy images

A policy image is identified using a three-part naming scheme: `org-name/repo-name:tag`.

:::note
Just like with docker images, if the `tag` is omitted, it will default to `:latest`.
