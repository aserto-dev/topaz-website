# Creating a Policy

To create a new policy, use the `policy init` command:

```
policy init
```

You'll be asked to select a server. Assuming you've logged in to the Aserto Policy Registry, you'll be able to select from following:

```
  #  SERVER
  1  opcr.io
  2  registry.prod.aserto.com

> Select server#:
```

If you haven't logged in to the Aserto Policy Registry, you'll only see the `opcr` option. After selecting a server you'll be asked to confirm your choice, or otherwise override it with a different value:

```
server: (registry.prod.aserto.com):
```

Hitting "Enter" will confirm your choice. Otherwise, provide a different value and hit "Enter".

Next, provide your username in the policy registry you've selected:

```
> user  : ([YOUR_USER_NAME]):
```

Provide the _name_ of the secret containing the Github token you'd like to use (by default, the name should be `GITHUB_TOKEN`)

```
> github secret name: (GITHUB_TOKEN): GITHUB_TOKEN
```

Specify the name of the repository you'll be pushing the policy to:

```
> repo  : (): [YOUR-ORGANIZATION]/[POLICY-NAME]
```

The following directory structure will be created:

```
.
├── .github
│   ├── config.yaml
│   └── workflows
│       └── build-release-policy.yaml
├── .gitignore
└── src
    ├── .manifest
    └── policies
        └── hello.rego
```

Update the content of the policy as needed, then follow the steps to [build](/docs/command-line-interface/policy-cli/build), [tag](/docs/command-line-interface/policy-cli/tag) and [push](/docs/command-line-interface/policy-cli/push) the policy to OPCR.
