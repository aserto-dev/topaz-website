# Tests

Topaz makes it easy to define and run a set of test cases known as **assertions**, to help test the model and prove that it authorizes correctly.

## Defining assertions

Assertions are managed in a JSON file, by default named `assertions.json`.

`topaz test template` emits a skeleton assertions file to stdout. 

Example:

```shell
topaz test template
{
  "assertions": [
	{"check": {"object_type": "", "object_id": "", "relation": "", "subject_type": "", "subject_id": ""}, "expected": true},
	{"check_relation": {"object_type": "", "object_id": "", "relation": "", "subject_type": "", "subject_id": ""}, "expected": true},
	{"check_permission": {"object_type": "", "object_id": "", "permission": "", "subject_type": "", "subject_id": ""}, "expected": true},
	{"check_decision": {"identity_context": {"identity": "", "type": ""}, "resource_context": {}, "policy_context": {"path": "", "decisions": [""]}}, "expected":true},
  ]
}
```

There are two types of assertions:
* `check`: define a test case that checks whether a `relation` (or permission) exists between an object (identified by `object_type` and `object_id`) and a subject (identified by `subject_type`, `subject_id`, and optionally `subject_relation`).
* `check_decision`: define a test case that executes the authorizer `is` API over the given `identity_context`, `resource_context`, and `policy_context`

Both types of assertions also include an `expected` key, which can be either `true` or `false` depending on whether the `check` is supposed to succeed or fail.

:::note
The `check_relation` and `check_permission` are shown for backward-compatibility but are no longer used.

## Running assertions

`topaz test exec` executes the assertions in a JSON file of the proper format, defaulting to `./assertions.json`. To specify a different file name, use the filename argument. 

Example:

1. Create the following `assertions.json` file, which defines a set of test cases for the data in the `todo` template:

```json
{
    "assertions": [
        {"check":{"subject_type":"user","subject_id":"rick@the-citadel.com","relation":"member","object_type":"group","object_id":"admin"},"expected":true},
        {"check":{"subject_type":"user","subject_id":"rick@the-citadel.com","relation":"member","object_type":"group","object_id":"evil_genius"},"expected":true},
        {"check":{"subject_type":"user","subject_id":"rick@the-citadel.com","relation":"member","object_type":"group","object_id":"editor"},"expected":false},
        {"check":{"subject_type":"user","subject_id":"rick@the-citadel.com","relation":"member","object_type":"group","object_id":"viewer"},"expected":false},

        {"check":{"subject_type":"user","subject_id":"morty@the-citadel.com","relation":"member","object_type":"group","object_id":"admin"},"expected":false},
        {"check":{"subject_type":"user","subject_id":"morty@the-citadel.com","relation":"member","object_type":"group","object_id":"evil_genius"},"expected":false},
        {"check":{"subject_type":"user","subject_id":"morty@the-citadel.com","relation":"member","object_type":"group","object_id":"editor"},"expected":true},
        {"check":{"subject_type":"user","subject_id":"morty@the-citadel.com","relation":"member","object_type":"group","object_id":"viewer"},"expected":false},
        
        {"check":{"subject_type":"user","subject_id":"summer@the-smiths.com","relation":"member","object_type":"group","object_id":"admin"},"expected":false},
        {"check":{"subject_type":"user","subject_id":"summer@the-smiths.com","relation":"member","object_type":"group","object_id":"evil_genius"},"expected":false},
        {"check":{"subject_type":"user","subject_id":"summer@the-smiths.com","relation":"member","object_type":"group","object_id":"editor"},"expected":true},
        {"check":{"subject_type":"user","subject_id":"summer@the-smiths.com","relation":"member","object_type":"group","object_id":"viewer"},"expected":false},

        {"check":{"subject_type":"user","subject_id":"beth@the-smiths.com","relation":"member","object_type":"group","object_id":"admin"},"expected":false},
        {"check":{"subject_type":"user","subject_id":"beth@the-smiths.com","relation":"member","object_type":"group","object_id":"evil_genius"},"expected":false},
        {"check":{"subject_type":"user","subject_id":"beth@the-smiths.com","relation":"member","object_type":"group","object_id":"editor"},"expected":false},
        {"check":{"subject_type":"user","subject_id":"beth@the-smiths.com","relation":"member","object_type":"group","object_id":"viewer"},"expected":true},

        {"check":{"subject_type":"user","subject_id":"jerry@the-smiths.com","relation":"member","object_type":"group","object_id":"admin"},"expected":false},
        {"check":{"subject_type":"user","subject_id":"jerry@the-smiths.com","relation":"member","object_type":"group","object_id":"evil_genius"},"expected":false},
        {"check":{"subject_type":"user","subject_id":"jerry@the-smiths.com","relation":"member","object_type":"group","object_id":"editor"},"expected":false},
        {"check":{"subject_type":"user","subject_id":"jerry@the-smiths.com","relation":"member","object_type":"group","object_id":"viewer"},"expected":true},
    ]
}
```
