# Managing data

Topaz offers four commands to manage data (objects and relations):

```shell
  import             import directory objects
  export             export directory objects
  backup             backup directory data
  restore            restore directory data
```

## Importing objects and relations

`topaz import` imports objects and relations in JSON format into the Topaz directory. It takes a directory argument and attempts to import all JSON files in that directory.

Example:

```shell
topaz import -d .
>>> importing data from /Users/ogazitt/.config/topaz/data
   object types skipped
    permissions skipped
 relation types skipped
        objects 19
      relations 20
```

### JSON format

The format for the JSON files looks like this:

Each file is a JSON object with an `objects` key or a `relations` key, which in turn provide an array of `object` or `relation` objects.

#### Objects

```json
{
  "objects": [
    {
      "type": "group",
      "id": "admin",
      "display_name": "admin-group",
      "properties": {},
    },
    ...
  ]
```

Note that each object must have a `type` key, and the value must be defined as one of the `types` in the manifest.  Each object also must have a unique `id` key (within the scope of that type). Finally, an object may have an optional `display_name` and an optional `properties` bag.

#### Relations

```json
{
  "relations": [
    {
      "object_type": "group",
      "object_id": "admin",
      "relation": "member",
      "subject_type": "user",
      "subject_id": "rick@the-citadel.com"
    },
    ...
  ]
```

Note that each relation has at least five fields:
* `object_type`: type of the source object (defined in the manifest)
* `object_id`: unique ID of the source object
* `relation`: a valid relation for `object_type`, defined in the manifest
* `subject_type`: the type of the target of the relationship (defined in the manifest)
* `subject_id`: unique ID of the target object
* `subject_relation`: (OPTIONAL) target relation, in case the manifest defines the relation target as `type#relation`.

## Exporting objects and relations

`topaz export` dumps the objects and relations into two files called `objects.json` and `relations.json`, in the directory specified with the `-d` option.

Example:

```shell
topaz export -d . -i
>>> exporting data to .
   object types skipped
    permissions skipped
 relation types skipped
        objects 19
      relations 20
```

## Backing up a directory

`topaz backup` creates a tarball with the objects.json and relations.json files. The file is named `backup.tar.gz` by default. To choose a different name, pass in the filename argument.

Example:

```shell
topaz backup -i b.tar.gz
>>> backup to b.tar.gz
   object types skipped
    permissions skipped
 relation types skipped
        objects 19
      relations 20
```

## Restoring a directory from a backup

`topaz restore` restores the directory data from a tarball named `backup.tar.gz` by default. To choose a different name, pass in the filename argument.

Example:

```shell
topaz restore  -i backup.tar.gz
>>> restore from /tmp/new/backup.tar.gz
   object types skipped
    permissions skipped
 relation types skipped
        objects 19
      relations 20
```
