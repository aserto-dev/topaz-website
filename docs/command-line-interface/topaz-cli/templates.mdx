# Installing templates

Topaz includes some built-in templates to make it easy to get started.

A template references three types of artifacts:
* an authorization policy
* a domain model (in the form of a manifest file)
* sample data (e.g. users, groups, objects, relationships)

## Listing templates

`topaz templates list` lists the set of available templates.

Example:

```shell
topaz templates list

  NAME          DESCRIPTION                                                        DOCUMENTATION

  github        Authorization template for repositories, organizations and teams.  https://docs.aserto.com/docs/quickstarts/github/overview                         
  ...
```

## Installing a template

`topaz templates install` installs a template. **Note that this will replace the existing manifest and remove all existing data!**

Example:

```shell
topaz templates install todo

Installing this template will completely reset your topaz configuration.

## Artifacts

This command installs the following artifacts in `$HOME/.config/topaz/`:

```shell
tree $HOME/.config/topaz
/Users/ogazitt/.config/topaz
├── certs
│   ├── gateway-ca.crt
│   ├── gateway.crt
│   ├── gateway.key
│   ├── grpc-ca.crt
│   ├── grpc.crt
│   └── grpc.key
├── cfg
│   └── config.yaml
├── data
│   ├── citadel_objects.json
│   └── citadel_relations.json
├── db
│   └── directory.db
└── model
    └── manifest.yaml
```

* `certs/` contains a set of generated self-signed certificates for Topaz.
* `cfg/config.yaml` contains a Topaz configuration file which references the sample Todo **policy image**. A policy image is an OCI image that contains an OPA policy. For the Todo template, this is the public GHCR image `ghcr.io/aserto-policies/policy-todo:latest`. The source code for the policy image can be found [here](https://github.com/aserto-templates/policy-todo/tree/main/content/src/policies).
* `data/` contains the objects and relations for the Todo template - in this case, a set of 5 users and 4 groups that are based on the "Rick & Morty" cartoon.
* `db/directory.db` contains the embedded database which houses the model and data.
* `model/manifest.yaml` contains the manifest file which describes the domain model.

## Additional actions

Besides laying down the artifacts mentioned, installing the Todo template invoked the following actions:

* started Topaz in daemon (background) mode (see [starting Topaz](start)).
* set the manifest found in `model/manifest.yaml` (see [setting the manifest](manifest#setting-a-manifest)).
* imported the objects and relations found in `data/` (see [importing data](data#importing-objects-and-relations)).
* opened a browser window to the Topaz [console](https://localhost:8080/ui/directory) (see the [console](console)).
