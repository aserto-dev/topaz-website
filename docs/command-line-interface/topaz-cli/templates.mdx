# Installing templates

Topaz includes some built-in templates to make it easy to get started.

A template references three types of artifacts:
* an authorization policy
* a domain model (in the form of a manifest file)
* sample data (e.g. users, groups, objects, relationships)

## Listing templates

`topaz templates list` lists the set of available templates.

Example:

```shell
topaz templates list

  NAME          DESCRIPTION                                                        DOCUMENTATION

  github        Authorization template for repositories, organizations and teams.  https://docs.aserto.com/docs/quickstarts/github/overview                         
  ...
```

## Installing a template

`topaz templates install` installs a template. **Note that this will replace the existing manifest and remove all existing data!**

Example:

```shell
topaz templates install todo

Installing this template will completely reset your topaz configuration.

```

## Artifacts

This command installs configuration artifacts in the Topaz configuration directory. To find out where this is, see [configuration](/docs/command-line-interface/topaz-cli/configuration.mdx). Unless you've set `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, this should be `$HOME/.config/topaz/`.

```sh
tree $HOME/.config/topaz
/Users/ogazitt/.config/topaz
├── cfg
│   └── todo.yaml
└── topaz.json
```

* `cfg/todo.yaml` contains a Topaz configuration file which references the sample Todo **policy image**. A policy image is an OCI image that contains an OPA policy. For the Todo template, this is the public GHCR image `ghcr.io/aserto-policies/policy-todo:latest`. The source code for the policy image can be found [here](https://github.com/aserto-templates/policy-todo/tree/main/content/src/policies).
* `topaz.json` contains all the installed configurations, as well as other topaz defaults.

### Data and template artifacts

The command also data and template artifacts in the Topaz data directory (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/topaz`), which defaults to `$HOME/.local/share/topaz` on Mac/Linux and `$HOME\AppData\Local\topaz` on Windows.

When Topaz starts, it will also create certificates in a `certs` directory under this path.

```shell
tree $HOME/.local/share/topaz
/Users/ogazitt/.local/share/topaz
├── certs
│   ├── gateway-ca.crt
│   ├── gateway.crt
│   ├── gateway.key
│   ├── grpc-ca.crt
│   ├── grpc.crt
│   └── grpc.key
├── db
│   └── todo.db
└── tmpl
    └── todo
        ├── data
        │   ├── citadel_objects.json
        │   ├── citadel_relations.json
        │   ├── todo_objects.json
        │   └── todo_relations.json
        └── model
            └── manifest.yaml

* `certs/` contains a set of generated self-signed certificates for Topaz.
that are based on the "Rick & Morty" cartoon.
* `db/todo.db` contains the embedded database which houses the model and data.
* `tmpl/todo/data/` contains the objects and relations that the template loads. The `citadel` files contain the users and groups associated with the "Citadel" demo IDP, and the `todo` files contain the template-specific objecs and relations.
* `tmpl/todo/model/manifest.yaml` contains the directory manifest for the Todo template.

Some templates also contain an `assertions/` subdirectory, which contains test cases for the model.

## Additional actions

Besides laying down the artifacts mentioned, installing the Todo template invoked the following actions:

* started Topaz in daemon (background) mode (see [starting Topaz](start)).
* set the manifest found in `tmpl/todo/model/manifest.yaml` (see [setting the manifest](manifest#setting-a-manifest)).
* imported the objects and relations found in `tmpl/todo/data/` (see [importing data](data#importing-objects-and-relations)).
* opened a browser window to the Topaz [console](https://localhost:8080/ui/directory) (see the [console](console)).
