# Directory commands

Topaz offers a number of commands to interact with the directory:

```shell
Usage: topaz directory (ds) <command> [flags]

directory commands

Commands:
  directory (ds) check      check permission
  directory (ds) search     search relation graph
  directory (ds) get        get object|relation|manifest
  directory (ds) set        set object|relation|manifest
  directory (ds) delete     delete object|relation|manifest
  directory (ds) list       list objects|relations
  directory (ds) import     import directory data
  directory (ds) export     export directory data
  directory (ds) backup     backup directory data
  directory (ds) restore    restore directory data
  directory (ds) test       execute directory assertions

Flags:
  -h, --help        Show context-sensitive help.
  -N, --no-check    disable local container status check ($TOPAZ_NO_CHECK)
  -L, --log         log level
```

## Command categories

These fall into four categories. The first category of commands is documented on this page, and the other categories are split into their own pages.

1. Getting, setting, deleting, and listing objects and relations, and executing `check` and `search` calls. This page focuses on these commands.
2. Getting, setting, and deleting the manifest, documented [here](./manifest.mdx).
3. Bulk directory operations - `import`, `export`, `backup`, and `restore`, documented [here](./data.mdx).
4. Defining and executing tests, documented [here](./test.mdx).

## Listing objects and relations

`topaz directory list objects <options>` and `topaz directory list relations <options>` can be used to retrieve objects and relations, respectively.

The `<options>` parameter is a string containing a JSON object, which can be specified minimally as an empty object - `'{}'`. 

### Listing objects

You can specify the `object_type` as a filter to return only objects of this type, as in the example below.

```shell
topaz directory list objects '{"object_type":"user"}' --insecure
{
  "results": [
    {
      "type": "user",
      "id": "beth@the-smiths.com",
      "display_name": "Beth Smith",
      "properties": {
        "email": "beth@the-smiths.com",

          "viewer"
        ],
        "status": "USER_STATUS_ACTIVE"
      },

    },
    {
      "type": "user",

      "display_name": "Morty Smith",
      "properties": {

      "etag": "14932635147313973396"
    },
    {
      "type": "user",
      "id": "rick@the-citadel.com",
      "display_name": "Rick Sanchez",
      "properties": {
        "email": "rick@the-citadel.com",
        "picture": "https://www.topaz.sh/assets/templates/citadel/img/Rick%20Sanchez.jpg",
        "roles": [
          "admin",
          "evil_genius"
        ],
        "status": "USER_STATUS_ACTIVE"
      },
      "created_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.619098467Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.619098467Z",
      "etag": "948604866316391264"
    },
    {
      "type": "user",
      "id": "summer@the-smiths.com",
      "display_name": "Summer Smith",
      "properties": {
        "email": "summer@the-smiths.com",
        "picture": "https://www.topaz.sh/assets/templates/citadel/img/Summer%20Smith.jpg",
        "roles": [
          "editor"
        ],
        "status": "USER_STATUS_ACTIVE"
      },
      "created_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.619145676Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.619145676Z",
      "etag": "17144384861342240382"
    }
  ],
  "page": {
    "next_token": ""
  }
}
```

To return all objects, simply pass in an empty object as the argument: `'{}'`.

### Listing relations

To return relations, use the `topaz directory list relations <options>` command. Note that the relations returned can be filtered by many different fields. To examine the format of the `options` parameter, you can print a template:

```sh
topaz directory list relations -t
{
  "object_type": "",
  "object_id": "",
  "relation": "",
  "subject_type": "",
  "subject_id": "",
  "subject_relation": "",
  "with_objects": false,
  "with_empty_subject_relation": false,
  "page": {
    "size": 100,
    "token": ""
  }
}
```

You can specify the `"with_objects": true` flag to return all the objects associated with the returned relations, and you can use the returned `page` token to page through results that are larger than the requested number of items.

The other fields represent various filters that you can apply to scope down the set of returned relations.

For example, to list all relations between groups and users (i.e. group membership), you can use this command:

```sh
topaz directory list relations '{"subject_type": "user", "object_type":"group"}' --insecure
{
  "results": [
    {
      "object_type": "group",
      "object_id": "admin",
      "relation": "member",
      "subject_type": "user",
      "subject_id": "rick@the-citadel.com",
      "subject_relation": "",
      "created_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.619572676Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.619572676Z",
      "etag": "7520381670766297568"
    },
    {
      "object_type": "group",
      "object_id": "editor",
      "relation": "member",
      "subject_type": "user",
      "subject_id": "morty@the-citadel.com",
      "subject_relation": "",
      "created_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.619593092Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.619593092Z",
      "etag": "15157237189428420024"
    },
    {
      "object_type": "group",
      "object_id": "editor",
      "relation": "member",
      "subject_type": "user",
      "subject_id": "summer@the-smiths.com",
      "subject_relation": "",
      "created_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.619613301Z",

      "etag": "439012067560497190"
    },
    {
      "object_type": "group",
      "object_id": "evil_genius",
      "relation": "member",
      "subject_type": "user",
      "subject_id": "rick@the-citadel.com",
      "subject_relation": "",
      "created_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.619663009Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.619663009Z",
      "etag": "15435570770464182199"
    },
    {
      "object_type": "group",
      "object_id": "viewer",
      "relation": "member",
      "subject_type": "user",
      "subject_id": "beth@the-smiths.com",
      "subject_relation": "",
      "created_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.619683342Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.619683342Z",
      "etag": "2091913623852294601"
    },
    {
      "object_type": "group",
      "object_id": "viewer",
      "relation": "member",
      "subject_type": "user",
      "subject_id": "jerry@the-smiths.com",
      "subject_relation": "",
      "created_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.619703759Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.619703759Z",
      "etag": "14562633183270406358"
    }
  ],
  "objects": {},
  "page": {
    "next_token": ""
  }
}
```

## Getting objects and relations

### Getting an object

To get a specific object by type and ID, you can use the `topaz directory get object <options>` command, the template for which is given below:

```sh
topaz directory get object -t
{
  "object_type": "",
  "object_id": "",
  "with_relations": false,
  "page": {
    "size": 100,
    "token": ""
  }
}
```

You must minimally specify the `object_type` and `object_id` fields, and you can use the `with_relations` flag to return all relations associated with the object.

For example, to return the object associated with the `user` identified by `rick@the-citadel.com`:

```shell
topaz directory get object '{ "object_type": "user", "object_id": "rick@the-citadel.com" }' --insecure
{
  "result": {
    "type": "user",
    "id": "rick@the-citadel.com",
    "display_name": "Rick Sanchez",
    "properties": {
      "email": "rick@the-citadel.com",
      "picture": "https://www.topaz.sh/assets/templates/citadel/img/Rick%20Sanchez.jpg",
      "roles": [
        "admin",
        "evil_genius"
      ],
      "status": "USER_STATUS_ACTIVE"
    },
    "created_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.619098467Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.619098467Z",
    "etag": "948604866316391264"
  },
  "relations": [],
  "page": {
    "next_token": ""
  }
}
```

### Getting a relation

Getting a specific relation is useful when you want to retrieve all the objects associated with it, or if you need to retrieve the `etag` of the current version of the object (more on this when we discuss updating an object).

```sh
topaz directory get relation -t
{
  "object_type": "",
  "object_id": "",
  "relation": "",
  "subject_type": "",
  "subject_id": "",
  "subject_relation": "",
  "with_objects": true
}
```

The first five fields are required to identify the specific relation, and if the relation contains a `subject_relation`, this field is also required.

Setting the `with_objects` flag to `true` will return the objects on either side of the relation (i.e. both the subject and the object).

```sh
topaz directory get relation '{
"object_type": "group",
"object_id": "viewer",
"relation": "member",
"subject_type": "user",
"subject_id": "jerry@the-smiths.com",
"with_objects": true
}' -i
{
  "result": {
    "object_type": "group",
    "object_id": "viewer",
    "relation": "member",
    "subject_type": "user",
    "subject_id": "jerry@the-smiths.com",
    "subject_relation": "",
    "created_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.619703759Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.619703759Z",
    "etag": "14562633183270406358"
  },
  "objects": {
    "group:viewer": {
      "type": "group",
      "id": "viewer",
      "display_name": "viewer-group",
      "properties": {},
      "created_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.618941134Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.618941134Z",
      "etag": "2381165995612044426"
    },
    "user:jerry@the-smiths.com": {
      "type": "user",
      "id": "jerry@the-smiths.com",
      "display_name": "Jerry Smith",
      "properties": {
        "email": "jerry@the-smiths.com",
        "picture": "https://www.topaz.sh/assets/templates/citadel/img/Jerry%20Smith.jpg",
        "roles": [
          "viewer"
        ],
        "status": "USER_STATUS_ACTIVE"
      },
      "created_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.619019634Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-05-21T01:02:11.619019634Z",
      "etag": "15557840156269755274"
    }
  }
}
```

## Setting objects and relations

You can create or update objects or relations using the following commands:
* `topaz directory set object <options>`
* `topaz directory set relation <options>`

### Setting objects

To create a new object, you must minimally specify its `type` and `id`:

```sh
topaz directory set object -t
{
  "object": {
    "type": "",
    "id": "",
    "display_name": "",
    "properties": {},
    "created_at": "2024-05-21T23:44:27.803675Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-05-21T23:44:27.803675Z",
    "etag": ""
  }
}
```

For example, to create a new user with the `enabled` property set to `true`:

```sh
topaz directory set object '{
"object": {
  "type": "user",
  "id": "newuser@the-citadel.com",
  "display_name": "New User",
  "properties": { "enabled": true }
  }
}' -i
{
  "result": {
    "type": "user",
    "id": "newuser@the-citadel.com",
    "display_name": "New User",
    "properties": {
      "enabled": true
    },
    "created_at": "2024-05-21T23:47:26.162265134Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-05-21T23:47:26.162265134Z",
    "etag": "17174959649333040925"
  }
}
```

You can use the exact same syntax to update the state of an existing object. Note that while Topaz supports the `etag` protocol for optimistic concurrency control using the directory `SetObject` gRPC and REST APIs, the `topaz directory set` commands do not use the protocol, and simply overwrite the entire object regardless of whether an `etag` is sent with the request.

### Setting relations

To create or update a relation:

```sh
topaz directory set relation -t
{
  "relation": {
    "object_type": "",
    "object_id": "",
    "relation": "",
    "subject_type": "",
    "subject_id": "",
    "subject_relation": "",
    "created_at": "2024-05-21T23:56:33.876467Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-05-21T23:56:33.876467Z",
    "etag": ""
  }
}
```

For example:

```sh
topaz directory set relation '
{
  "relation": {
    "object_type": "group",
    "object_id": "admin",
    "relation": "member",
    "subject_type": "user",
    "subject_id": "newuser@the-citadel.com"
  }
}' --insecure
{
  "result": {
    "object_type": "group",
    "object_id": "admin",
    "relation": "member",
    "subject_type": "user",
    "subject_id": "newuser@the-citadel.com",
    "subject_relation": "",
    "created_at": "2024-05-21T23:58:30.747420386Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-05-21T23:58:30.747420386Z",
    "etag": "3727662736522093748"
  }
}
```

## Deleting objects and relations

You must fully specify the object (`type` and `id`), or the relation (`object_type`, `object_id`, `relation`, `subject_type`, `subject_id`, and if it exists, `subject_relation`).

### Deleting objects

Template:

```sh
topaz directory delete object -t
{
  "object_type": "",
  "object_id": "",
  "with_relations": false
}
```

For example, to delete the object we just created, along with its relation:

```sh
topaz directory delete object '
{
  "object_type": "user",
  "object_id": "newuser@the-citadel.com",
  "with_relations": true
}' --insecure
{
  "result": {}
}
```

### Deleting relations

You must fully specify the relation:

```sh
topaz directory delete relation -t
{
  "object_type": "",
  "object_id": "",
  "relation": "",
  "subject_type": "",
  "subject_id": "",
  "subject_relation": ""
}
```

## Check command

The `topaz directory check` command determines whether an object has a relation to (or permission on) a subject.

For example, to check whether the user `rick@the-citadel.com`com is a member of the `viewer` group, issue the following command:

```sh
topaz ds check '
{
  "object_type": "group",
  "object_id": "viewer",
  "relation": "member",
  "subject_type": "user",
  "subject_id":
  "rick@the-citadel.com"
}' --insecure
{
  "check": true,
  "trace": []
}
```

## Search command

The `topaz directory search` command is a powerful way to walk the graph and find all the subjects that have a relation to a certain object, or vice versa.

### Objects search

For example, to determine which groups the user `rick@the-citadel.com` is a member of, we can use a `search` command. The format is exactly the same as the `check` command, but you can omit the `object_id` field to return all the objects of type `group` that have a `member` relation to this `user`:

```sh
topaz ds search '
{
  "object_type": "group",
  "relation": "member",
  "subject_type": "user",
  "subject_id":
  "rick@the-citadel.com"
}' --insecure
{
  "results": [
    {
      "object_type": "group",
      "object_id": "editor"
    },
    {
      "object_type": "group",
      "object_id": "viewer"
    },
    {
      "object_type": "group",
      "object_id": "admin"
    },
    {
      "object_type": "group",
      "object_id": "evil_genius"
    }
  ],
  "explanation": null,
  "trace": []
}
```

### Subjects search

We can also search the other way. To determine which users are members of the `admin` group, issue the following search command, this time omitting the `subject_id` field to return all the subjects that fit the search:

```sh
topaz ds search '
{
  "object_type": "group",
  "object_id": "admin",
  "relation": "member",
  "subject_type": "user"
}' --insecure
{
  "results": [
    {
      "object_type": "user",
      "object_id": "rick@the-citadel.com"
    }
  ],
  "explanation": null,
  "trace": []
}
```

### Explain

To explain the graph traversals for the `check` and `search` commands, use the `explain` flag. 

For example, to learn why the user `rick@the-citadel.com` is a member of the `editor` group, you can see that Rick is a member of the `admin` group, and the `admin#members` subject-relation is a member of the `editors` group, while the other two members are assigned directly to the `editor` group:

```sh
topaz ds search '
{
  "object_type": "group",
  "object_id": "admin",
  "relation": "member",
  "subject_type": "user"
  "explain": true
}' --insecure
{
  "results": [
    {
      "object_type": "user",
      "object_id": "rick@the-citadel.com"
    },
    {
      "object_type": "user",
      "object_id": "morty@the-citadel.com"
    },
    {
      "object_type": "user",
      "object_id": "summer@the-smiths.com"
    }
  ],
  "explanation": {
    "user:morty@the-citadel.com": [
      [
        "group:editor#member@user:morty@the-citadel.com"
