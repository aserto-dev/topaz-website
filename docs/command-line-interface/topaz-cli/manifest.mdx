# Managing the manifest

Topaz offers three commands to manage the manifest:

```shell
  manifest get       get manifest
  manifest set       set manifest
  manifest delete    delete manifest
```

## Getting the manifest

`topaz manifest get` retrieves the current manifest and prints it to stdout.

Example:

```shell
topaz manifest get -i
>>> get manifest to
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://www.topaz.sh/schema/manifest.json
---

### filename: manifest.yaml ###
### datetime: 2023-10-17T00:00:00-00:00 ###
### description: citadel manifest ###

### model ###
model:
  version: 3

### object type definitions ###
types:
  ### display_name: User ###
  user:
    relations:
      ### display_name: user#manager ###
      manager: user

  ### display_name: Identity ###
  identity:
    relations:
      ### display_name: identity#identifier ###
      identifier: user

  ### display_name: Group ###
  group:
    relations:
      ### display_name: group#member ###
      member: user
```

## Setting a manifest

`topaz manifest set` set the manifest from stdin. You can also specify a filename as an argument.

Example:

```shell
topaz manifest set -i ./manifest.yaml
>>> set manifest from /Users/ogazitt/.config/topaz/model/manifest.yaml
```

## Deleting the manifest

`topaz manifest delete` removes the manifest and **deletes all data**. After deleting a manifest, you must set a new manifest before you can use the Topaz directory.

:::note
`topaz load` and `topaz save` have been deprecated in favor of `manifest set` and `manifest get`, respectively.
