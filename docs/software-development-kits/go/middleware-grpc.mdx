# gRPC Middleware

Using authorization middleware when building gRPC servers focuses the responsibility of making authorization decisions to a single component instead of fragmenting the logic across many service methods.

The middleware can be configured to retrieve authorization information, such as user identity, from incoming messages and streams.

## Creating Middleware

Creating middleware requires two arguments: an [authorizer client](/docs/software-development-kits/go/authorizer), and a `Policy` that identifies the authorization policy to be applied, the decision rule to evaluate, and optionally a path to a policy module. If a path isn't provided, the middleware infers the policy path from the incoming request's URL. This behavior too can be further customized to fit other naming schemes.

```go
import (
    middleware "github.com/aserto-dev/aserto-go/middleware/grpc"
)

...

// Create gRPC middleware.
mw := middleware.New(
    authClient,
    mw.Policy{
        Decision: "allowed",             // Name of the policy rule to evaluate.
    },
)
```

## Configuring Middleware

Middleware can be configured to extract authorization information from incoming requests. This information includes:

1. Identity: the identity of the caller.
2. Policy Path: the policy module to evaluate (e.g. `"peoplefinder.GET.api.users.__id"`).
3. Resource: contextual information about the resource being accessed.

### Identity

[Identity](/docs/authorizer-guide/identity-context) information is set on the middleware's `.Identity`.

For example, to read a subject name from a `"username"` context value on the incoming request (presumably, set by some
authentication middleware):

```go
mw.Identity.Subject().FromContextValue("username")
```

Or, to configure the middleware to identify callers using a JWT in the `"identity"`
[metadata](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/metadata) key on the incoming request context:
request context:

```go
mw.Identity.JWT().FromMetadata("identity")
```

### Policy Path

If a policy path isn't specified when the middleware is created, it will be inferred from the request method,
replacing path separators (`/`) with dots(`.`) (e.g. `/service/method` becomes, `service.method`).

To provide your own logic for determining the policy path use:

```go
mw.WithPolicyPathMapper(
    func((ctx context.Context, message interface{})) string {
        // custom logic inspects the request and returns the policy path.
    },
)
```

### Resource

[Resource](/docs/authorizer-guide/resource-context) information can be added to authorization requests using
`.WithResourceMapper()`:

```go
mw.WithResourceMapper(
    func(ctx, context.Context, message interface{}, resource map[string]interface{}) {
        // Custom function to retrieve the owner of the resource being accessed.
        resource["ownerId"] = GetOwner(ctx, message)
    },
)
```

## Connecting Middleware

With a configured middleware in hand, all that's left is connecting it to your gRPC server:

```go
// Create gRPC server with middleware.
s := grpc.NewServer(
    grpc.UnaryInterceptor(mw.Unary),
    grpc.StreamInterceptor(mw.Stream),
)
```
