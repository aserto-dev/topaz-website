# Authorizer Client

[`AuthorizerClient`](https://github.com/aserto-dev/aserto-java/blob/98e155e0305d14685256b2bde0d14e4b58f1bc75/src/main/java/com/aserto/AuthorizerClient.java#L13) is an abstraction over the raw grpc bindings that talks to the Aserto [authorization API](/docs/authorizer-guide/authz).
It can be used to make authorization calls, or to create authorization middleware.


## Installation
The code is available as a [maven component](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.aserto/aserto-java/)
and can be easily added to you project by adding the maven dependency
```maven
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aserto</groupId>
    <artifactId>aserto-java</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

## Create a Client

```java
// create a channel that has the connection details
ManagedChannel channel = new ChannelBuilder()
        .withAddr("localhost:8282")
        .withCACertPath(<path_to_authorizer_certificates>)
        .build();

// create authz client
AuthorizerClient authzClient =  new AuthzClient(channel);
```

If you are using Topaz as am authorizer, the certificate is located at `~/.config/topaz/certs/grpc-ca.crt`
For dev/test scenarios  you can also use an insecure connection by replacing `.withCACertPath(<path_to_authorizer_certificates>)` with `.withInsecure(true)`

The `ChannelBuilder` accepts setting the fallowing properties:

| Method | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| withAddr(String) | authorizer address |
| withCACertPath(String) | path to certificate used for TLS connection to authorizer |
| withInsecure(Boolean) | use an isecure connection to the authorizer |
| withTenantId(String) | TenantId, not required for Topaz |
| withAPIKeyAuth(String) | auth key, not required for Topaz |
| withTokenAuth(String) | Auth0 token |

## Make Authorization Calls

```java
// identity context contains information abou the user that requests access to some resource
IdentityCtx identityCtx = new IdentityCtx("rick@the-citadel.com", IdentityType.IDENTITY_TYPE_SUB);

// contains information about the policy we want to check for the provided identity
PolicyCtx policyCtx = new PolicyCtx("todo", "todo", "todoApp.DELETE.todos.__id", new String[]{"allowed"});

// check if the identity is allowed to perform the action
List<Decision> decisions = authzClient.is(identityCtx, policyCtx);
authzClient.close();

decisions.forEach(decision -> {
    String dec = decision.getDecision();
    boolean isAllowed =  decision.getIs();
    System.out.println("For decision [" + dec + "] the answer was [" + isAllowed + "]");
});
```
