# ASP.NET Core Check Middleware (ReBAC)
In addition to the pattern described by the Aserto Middleware, in which each route is authorized by its own policy module, the check middleware can be used to implement Relation-Based Access Control (rebac) in which authorization decisions are made by checking if a given subject has the necessary permission or relation to the object being accessed.

This is achieved using the `Check` attribute of the `CheckMiddleware`.

A check call needs three pieces of information:
    - The type and key of the object.
    - The name of the relation or permission to look for.
    - The type and key of the subject. When omitted, the subject is derived from the middleware's Identity with type "user".

## Installation

[Aserto.AspNetCore.Middleware](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aserto.AspNetCore.Middleware/) is provided as a NuGet package.

It can be installed:

- Using Package Manager:

```powershell
Install-Package Aserto.AspNetCore.Middleware
```

- Using .NET CLI

```cmd
dotnet add package Aserto.AspNetCore.Middleware
```

## Configuration

The following configuration settings are required for Aserto.AspNetCore middleware to run with Topaz. You can add them to your `appsettings.json`:

```json
// appsettings.json

"Aserto": {
    "ServiceUrl": "https://localhost:8282",
    "PolicyName": "YOUR_POLICY_NAME",    
    "PolicyRoot": "YOUR_POLICY_ROOT"
}
```

These settings can be retrieved from the [Policy Settings](https://console.aserto.com/ui/policies) page of your Aserto account.

The middleware accepts the following optional parameters:

| Parameter name | Default value                             | Description                                                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enabled        | true                                      | Enables or disables Aserto Authorization.                                             |
| ServiceUrl     | `https://authorizer.prod.aserto.com:8443` | Sets the URL for the authorizer endpoint.                                             |
| Decision       | "allowed"                                 | The decision that will be used by the middleware when creating an authorizer request. |

## Usage 

To use the check middleware in the `Startup.cs` you will need to add the check options and allow the service to add the check authorization:
```
            CheckOptions checkOptions = new CheckOptions();
            Configuration.GetSection("Aserto").Bind(checkOptions.BaseOptions);
            // Adding the check middleware
            services.AddAsertoCheckAuthorization(checkOptions,
            authorizerConfig =>
            {
                Configuration.GetSection("Aserto").Bind(authorizerConfig);
            });
```

After the initialization in your controllers you can attach the check attribute to a method as show in the example bellow:
```
        [HttpPost]        
        [Check(objectID: "resource-creators", objectType: "resource-creator", relation: "member")]

```        

The [todo-dotnet-v2](https://github.com/aserto-demo/todo-dotnet-v2/tree/main) example highlights the usage of the ASP.NET Core Aserto middleware next to the ASP.NET Core Check Middleware.
