# Test your server with the Todo web application

The easy way to test is by simply navigating to a deployed version of the [todo web application](https://todo.demo.aserto.com). The todo app expects your back-end to be running on port 3001.

To build and run the todo application from source, see the section following "Testing the authorization model".

## Testing the authorization model

You should see the following login modal:

<img src="/img/samples/login.png" />

Start by logging in as the “admin” - `rick@the-citadel.com` and the password `V@erySecre#t123!`.
Add some todo items, and you should be able to see the following:

<img src="/img/samples/rick-todos.png" />

Log out, and log in again. This time as `morty@the-citadel.com` and the password `V@erySecre#t123!`. Create some additional todo items as Morty:

<img src="/img/samples/morty-todos.png" />

Since Morty is only an editor, he won't be able to delete a todo item he did not create. To test this, mark one of Morty's todo items as done:

<img src="/img/samples/morty-can-complete-his-own.png" />

Then, attempt to delete one of Rick's todo items you created before. You should see the following error:

<img src="/img/samples/morty-cant-complete-ricks.png" />

## Building and running the Todo web application from source

Alternatively, you can build and run the todo application from source.

### Clone the application
```
git clone https://github.com/aserto-demo/todo-application.git
```

### Install the application dependencies
```
cd todo-application
yarn
```

### Start the application
```
yarn start
```

Open your browser on `localhost:3000`.
