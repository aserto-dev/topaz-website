# Test your server with the Todo web application

### Clone the application
```
git clone https://github.com/aserto-demo/todo-application.git
```

### Install the application dependencies
```
cd todo-application
yarn
```

### Start the application
```
yarn start
```

Open your browser on `localhost:3000`. You should see the following log in dialog:

<img src="/img/samples/login.png" />

Start by logging in as the “admin” - `rick@the-citadel.com` and the password `V@erySecre#t123!`.
Add some todo items, and you should be able to see the following:

<img src="/img/samples/rick-todos.png" />

Log out, and log in again. This time as `morty@the-citadel.com` and the password `V@erySecre#t123!`. Create some additional todo items as Morty:

<img src="/img/samples/morty-todos.png" />

Since Morty is only an editor, he won't be able to delete a todo item he did not create. To test this, mark one of Morty's todo items as done:

<img src="/img/samples/morty-can-complete-his-own.png" />

Then, attempt to delete one of Rick's todo items you created before. You should see the following error:

<img src="/img/samples/morty-cant-complete-ricks.png" />
