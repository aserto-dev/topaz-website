# Node.JS

## Setup

### Clone the server
Start by cloning the server repository from GitHub. You can do this by running the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/aserto-demo/todo-node-js-v2
```

### Install dependencies
To install the application dependencies, run the following command:
```
yarn
```

### Set up the `.env` file
Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the `CA_FILE` path to correspond to the path in which Topaz generated your certificates (by default this path will be `$HOME/.config/topaz/certs/grpc-ca.crt`).

Also make sure that `ASERTO_AUTHORIZER_SERVICE_URL=localhost:8282` and `ASERTO_DIRECTORY_SERVICE_URL=localhost:9292`.
