import LanguagesList from '../../../src/components/LanguagesList'

To test Topaz with the policy for the Todo sample application, make sure you follow the instructions in the [previous section](/docs/getting-started/index.mdx) to properly install and configure Topaz.

The configuration file in `$HOME/.config/topaz/cfg/todo.yaml` should point to the policy image `ghcr.io/aserto-policies/policy-todo`.

You can view the policy modules [here](https://github.com/aserto-templates/policy-todo/tree/main/content/src/policies).

Continue setting up a server and a web application using your favorite language:
