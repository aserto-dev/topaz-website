# Setup

Topaz is packaged as a Docker container which requires a configuration file - an example configuration is available [here](/docs/getting-started/configuration). The example configuration file includes the location to a policy image that is store in a policy registry. The policy registry hosts OCI images which you can create and push with the [Policy CLI](https://github.com/opcr-io/policy).

After creating the configuration file, you can start the container with the following command:

To start Topaz locally, you'll need to have Docker installed and running. Then, run the following command:

{/* TODO: Update to final image */}
```bash
docker run -it --rm --name topaz -p 8282:8282 -p 8383:8383 -p 8484:8484\
 -v "$PWD/config-example.yaml:/aserto/cfg/config.yaml":ro \
 ghcr.io/aserto-dev/topaz:0.0.0-20220923170430.0.gd8fa40e0-dirty \
 run -c /aserto/cfg/config.yaml
```

After starting Topaz locally, you'll be able to run the following queries to test the policy:

## List policies

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://localhost:8383/api/v1/policy/policies'
```

## Next steps
1. Create your own policy
2. Push your policy to a registry
3. Update your configuration file to point to your policy
4. Restart Topaz
