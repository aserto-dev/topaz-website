   ```shell
  brew tap aserto-dev/tap && brew install aserto-dev/tap/topaz
   ```

* Via WinGet for Windows 10+
   ```shell
  winget install Aserto.Topaz
   ```

* On Windows 10+

  Download the `topaz_windows_x86_64.msi` file from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/aserto-dev/topaz/releases) and execute the MSI.

* Via a GO install

  ```shell
  go install github.com/aserto-dev/topaz/cmd/topaz@latest
  ```

## Quickstart

These instructions help you get Topaz up and running as the authorizer for a sample Todo app.

### Install Topaz authorizer container image

The Topaz authorizer is packaged as a Docker container.
Before using the container image installer ensure that you have a Docker runtime such as [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed.

You can get the latest image using the following command:

```shell
topaz install
```

:::caution Note
If you get the following errors/warnings from Topaz commands:

`Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?`

Be sure to allow the default Docker socket to be used in your Docker Desktop Advanced settings.

### Install the `todo` template

Topaz has a set of pre-built templates that contain three types of artifacts:
* an authorization policy
* a domain model (in the form of a manifest file)
* sample data (users, groups, objects, relationships)

You can use the CLI to install the todo template:

```shell
topaz templates install todo
```

#### Artifacts

This command installs configuration artifacts in the Topaz configuration directory. To find out where this is, see [configuration](/docs/command-line-interface/topaz-cli/configuration.mdx). Unless you've set `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, this should be `$HOME/.config/topaz/`.

```shell
tree $HOME/.config/topaz
/Users/ogazitt/.config/topaz
├── cfg
│   └── todo.yaml
└── topaz.json
```

* `cfg/todo.yaml` contains a Topaz configuration file which references the sample Todo **policy image**. A policy image is an OCI image that contains an OPA policy. For the Todo template, this is the public GHCR image `ghcr.io/aserto-policies/policy-todo:latest`. The source code for the policy image can be found [here](https://github.com/aserto-templates/policy-todo/tree/main/content/src/policies).
* `topaz.json` contains all the installed configurations, as well as other Topaz defaults.

##### Data and template artifacts

The command also data and template artifacts in the Topaz data directory (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/topaz`), which defaults to `$HOME/.local/share/topaz` on Mac/Linux and `$HOME\AppData\Local\topaz` on Windows.

When Topaz starts, it will also create certificates in a `certs` directory under this path.

```shell
tree $HOME/.local/share/topaz
/Users/ogazitt/.local/share/topaz
├── certs
│   ├── gateway-ca.crt
│   ├── gateway.crt
│   ├── gateway.key
│   ├── grpc-ca.crt
│   ├── grpc.crt
│   └── grpc.key
├── db
│   └── todo.db
└── tmpl
    └── todo
        ├── data
        │   ├── citadel_objects.json
        │   ├── citadel_relations.json
        │   ├── todo_objects.json
        │   └── todo_relations.json
        └── model
            └── manifest.yaml
```

* `certs/` contains a set of generated self-signed certificates for Topaz.
that are based on the "Rick & Morty" cartoon.
* `db/todo.db` contains the embedded database which houses the model and data.
* `tmpl/todo/data/` contains the objects and relations that the template loads. The `citadel` files contain the users and groups associated with the "Citadel" demo IDP, and the `todo` files contain the template-specific objecs and relations.
* `tmpl/todo/model/manifest.yaml` contains the directory manifest for the Todo template.

:::tip
For a deeper overview of the `cfg/config.yaml` file, see [topaz config](https://github.com/aserto-dev/topaz/blob/main/docs/config.md).

#### What just happened?

Besides laying down the artifacts mentioned, installing the Todo template did the following things:

* started Topaz in daemon (background) mode (see `topaz start --help`).
* set the manifest found in `tmpl/todo/model/manifest.yaml` (see `topaz directory set manifest --help`).
* imported the objects and relations found in `tmpl/todo/data/` (see `topaz directory import --help`).
* opened a browser window to the Topaz [console](https://localhost:8080/ui/directory) (see `topaz console --help`).

Feel free to play around with the Topaz console! Or follow the next few steps to interact with the Topaz policy and authorization endpoints.

### Issue an API call

To verify that Topaz is running with the right policy image, you can issue a `curl` call to interact with the REST API.

This API call retrieves the set of policies that Topaz has loaded:

```shell
curl -k https://localhost:8383/api/v2/policies
```

### Issue an authorization request

Issue an authorization request using the `is` REST API to verify that the user Rick is allowed to GET the list of todos.

#### As a curl

```shell
curl -k -X POST 'https://localhost:8383/api/v2/authz/is' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
     "identity_context": {
          "type": "IDENTITY_TYPE_SUB",
          "identity": "rick@the-citadel.com"
     },
     "policy_context": {
          "path": "todoApp.GET.todos",
          "decisions": ["allowed"]
     }
}'
```

#### Using the topaz CLI

```shell
topaz authorizer eval '{
     "identity_context": {
          "type": "IDENTITY_TYPE_SUB",
          "identity": "rick@the-citadel.com"
     },
     "policy_context": {
          "path": "todoApp.GET.todos",
          "decisions": ["allowed"]
     }
}' -i
```

## gRPC Endpoints

To interact with the authorizer endpoint over gRPC, install `grpcui` or `grpcurl` and point them to `localhost:8282`:

```shell
grpcui --insecure localhost:8282
```

To interact with the directory endpoint, use `localhost:9292`:

```shell
grpcui --insecure localhost:9292
```

## Next steps
1. Clone and run the Todo sample backend in your [favorite language](/docs/getting-started/samples).
2. Create your own directory [manifest](/docs/directory/define-domain-model).
3. Create your own [policy](/docs/policies).
4. Push your policy to a [registry](/docs/policies/lifecycle#policy-cli).
5. Start Topaz by pointing it to your new policy with `topaz config new` and `topaz start`.
