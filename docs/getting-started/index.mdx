# Setup

## Install the Topaz CLI
You can run Topaz using the `topaz-cli`. To install the CLI, run:

```bash
brew install topaz-cli
```

## Configuration

Topaz is packaged as a Docker container which requires a configuration file - an example configuration is available [here](/docs/getting-started/configuration). The example configuration file includes the location to a policy image that is store in a policy registry. The policy registry hosts OCI images which you can create and push with the [Policy CLI](https://github.com/opcr-io/policy).

{/* TODO: Update with CLI command to generate configuration */}

After creating the configuration file, you can start the container with the following command:

To start Topaz locally, you'll need to have Docker installed and running.

Then, run the following command:
```bash
topaz run
```

## Loading data

Once Topaz is running, you can load user data into the database using the [Topaz CLI](/docs/command-line-interface/topaz-cli/index):

{/* TODO: CLI Command to load data */}

After loading data into your Topaz instance, you'll be able to run the following queries to test the policy:

## List policies

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://localhost:8383/api/v1/policy/policies'
```

## Query the policy

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://localhost:8383/api/v2/authz/is' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
     "identity_context": {
          "type": "IDENTITY_TYPE_NONE",
          "identity": "rick@the-citadel.com"
     },
     "policy_context": {
          "path": "todoApp.GET.todos",
          "decisions": ["allowed"]

     }
}'



## Next steps
1. Create your own policy
2. Push your policy to a registry
3. Update your configuration file to point to your policy
4. Restart Topaz
