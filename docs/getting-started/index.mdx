# Setup

## Installation

`topaz` is available on Linux, macOS and Windows platforms.

* Binaries for Linux, Windows and Mac are available as tarballs in the [release](https://github.com/aserto-dev/topaz/releases) page.

* Via Homebrew for macOS or LinuxBrew for Linux

   ```shell
  brew tap aserto-dev/tap && brew install aserto-dev/tap/topaz
   ```

* On Windows 10+

  Download the `topaz_windows_x86_64.msi` file from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/aserto-dev/topaz/releases) and execute the MSI.

* Via a GO install

  ```shell
  go install github.com/aserto-dev/topaz/cmd/topaz@latest
  ```

## Quickstart

These instructions help you get Topaz up and running as the authorizer for a sample Todo app.

### Install Topaz authorizer container image

The Topaz authorizer is packaged as a Docker container. You can get the latest image using the following command:

```shell
topaz install
```

### Create a configuration

You can use the CLI to create a configuration file:

```shell
topaz configure -n <policy-name> -d -s -r <resource-url>
```

For example, this command creates a configuration file for the sample Todo policy image.

```shell
topaz configure -d -s -r ghcr.io/aserto-policies/policy-todo-rebac:latest -n policy-todo
```

The configuration file is generated in `$HOME/.config/topaz/cfg`.
* the config instructs Topaz to create a local directory instance (`-d`)
* when started, Topaz will seed the directory with default object types (`-s`)
* the config references an authorization policy for a sample "Todo" app, retrieved from the Open Policy Registry as a container image
* the config is named "policy-todo"

For an in-depth look on the configuration section see [topaz config](https://github.com/aserto-dev/topaz/blob/main/docs/config.md)

### Start Topaz in interactive mode

```shell
topaz run
```

### Import sample data

Once Topaz is running, you can load user data into the database using the [Topaz CLI](/docs/command-line-interface/topaz-cli/index.mdx).

The CLI contains commands to create schema and import data. In this quickstart we'll import the users, groups, and relationships for the Todo sample app.

First, retrieve the "Citadel" json files, placing them in the current directory:

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aserto-dev/topaz/main/assets/citadel/citadel_objects.json >./citadel_objects.json
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aserto-dev/topaz/main/assets/citadel/citadel_relations.json >./citadel_relations.json
```

Import the contents of the file into Topaz directory. This creates the sample users (Rick, Morty, and friends); groups; and relations.

```shell
topaz import -i -d .
```

### Issue an API call

To verify that Topaz is running with the right policy image, you can issue a `curl` call to interact with the REST API.

This API call retrieves the set of policies that Topaz has loaded:

```shell
curl -k https://localhost:8383/api/v2/policies
```

### Issue a query

Issue a query using the `is` REST API to verify that the user Rick is allowed to GET the list of todos:

```shell
curl -k -X POST 'https://localhost:8383/api/v2/authz/is' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
     "identity_context": {
          "type": "IDENTITY_TYPE_SUB",
          "identity": "rick@the-citadel.com"
     },
     "policy_context": {
          "path": "todoApp.GET.todos",
          "decisions": ["allowed"]
     }
}'
```

## gRPC Endpoints

To interact with the authorizer endpoint, install `grpcui` or `grpcurl` and point them to `localhost:8282`:

```shell
grpcui --insecure localhost:8282
```

To interact with the directory endpoint, use `localhost:9292`:

```shell
grpcui --insecure localhost:9292
```

## Next steps
1. Review a sample app in your [favorite language](/docs/getting-started/samples)
2. Create your own [policy](/docs/policies)
3. Push your policy to a [registry](/docs/policies/lifecycle#policy-cli)
4. Start Topaz by pointing it to your new policy with `topaz configure` and `topaz start`
