# Run in docker compose

Running topaz in docker compose is a great way to get started quickly.  It can be a useful as development environment for testing policies locally.

## Clone the repo

A sample docker-compose.yaml is included in the topaz repo.  Clone the repo to try it out.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/aserto-dev/topaz.git topaz
```

## Start docker compose

Install Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/, then start up topaz containers with:

```sh
cd topaz/assets/docker-compose
docker compose up
```

Within a minute or so you should see the topaz services and the web console start up:
```
topaz          | 8:44PM INF Starting 0.0.0.0:9292 GRPC server component=service-manager
topaz          | 8:44PM INF Starting 0.0.0.0:8081 GRPC server component=service-manager
topaz          | 8:44PM INF Starting 0.0.0.0:8282 GRPC server component=service-manager
topaz          | 8:44PM INF Starting 0.0.0.0:8080 Gateway server component=service-manager
topaz          | 8:44PM INF Starting 0.0.0.0:8383 Gateway server component=service-manager
topaz          | 8:44PM INF Starting 0.0.0.0:9393 Gateway server component=service-manager
topaz-console  | {"level":"info","time":"2023-11-27T20:44:19.996Z","pid":35,"hostname":"6d6218cae759","name":"self-hosted-console","msg":"Self Hosted Console server started on port 8080"}
```

## Browse to the console

In a web browser, visit http://localhost:8080 to access the web console.


## Load sample directory data

To load sample data, copy files from the topaz repo into the mounted /data directory so that the topaz container will have access to them.

```sh
cd assets/docker-compose
cp ./citadel/citadel_objects.json data
cp ../citadel/citadel_relations.json data
cp ../citadel/manifest.yaml data
```

Now evoke the topaz client inside the running container to import the sample manifest and data into the topaz edge directory.

```sh
docker compose exec topaz ./topaz manifest set --no-check -i /data/manifest.yaml
docker compose exec topaz ./topaz import --no-check -i -H localhost:9292 -d /data
```
