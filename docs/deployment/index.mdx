# Deployment Overview

Topaz is most easily deployed as a container, either as a [sidecar](sidecar.mdx) or as a [microservice](microservice.mdx) in the same region / AZ as the application it supports.

For environments that don't support running container images, Topaz can be run as a [binary](binary.mdx).
