# Deployment Overview

Topaz is most easily deployed as a container. In Kubernetes it can be deployed as a service using a [Helm chart](helm.mdx)
or as a [sidecar](sidecar.mdx) within application pods.
It can run in [AWS ECS](amazon-ecs.mdx) or as a [microservice](microservice.mdx) in the same region / AZ as the application it supports.

For environments that don't support running container images, Topaz can be run as a [binary](binary.mdx).

Running Topaz in [docker compose](docker-compose.mdx) is a great way to get started quickly and develop policies locally.
