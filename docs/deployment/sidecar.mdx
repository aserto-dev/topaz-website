# Deploy as a Sidecar

Deploying topaz as a sidecar next to your applications is the most efficient way to use the authorizer as it minimizes the authorization latency.

In this section we can follow an example deployment on minikube based on a golang backend application and topaz authorizer as a sidecar.

## Prepare minikube
Start by preparing minikube, you can follow the installation instructions [here](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).

Check if your minikube cluster is running:
```
minikube status

minikube
type: Control Plane
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured
```

## Preparing your backend application container
1. Clone [todo-go-v2](https://github.com/aserto-demo/todo-go-v2) repository 
2. Add the following docker file to the root of your repository

Dockerfile:
```
FROM golang:1.19-alpine AS build-dev
RUN apk add --no-cache bash gcc build-base
WORKDIR /src

ENV GOBIN=/bin
ENV ROOT_DIR=/src

COPY . .
RUN go build

FROM alpine

LABEL org.opencontainers.image.title="todo-go-v2"
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.version="latest"

RUN apk add --no-cache bash
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build-dev /src/todo-go /app/

EXPOSE 3001

ENTRYPOINT ["./todo-go"]
```

3. Use `docker build . -t todo-go-v2:latest` to build your backend application container

4. Load the docker image into the minikube environment using: `minikube image load todo-go-v2:latest`

## Prepare your deployment

Your deployment directory should contain the following files:

* [configmap.yaml](/sidecar-deployment/configmap.yaml)
* [deployment.yaml](/sidecar-deployment/deployment.yaml)
* [topaz-configmap.yaml](/sidecar-deployment/topaz-configmap.yaml)

## Apply the deployment 

To apply on your minikube cluster use: `kubectl apply -f . --recursive`

Once the deployment is finished you will have a pod that will contain 2 running containers that use the following images:
```
ghcr.io/aserto-dev/topaz:latest 
todo-go-v2:latest
```

Get the running pod name:
```
TODO_POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -n default -l 'app=todo' -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
```

## Testing the backend application 

If you want to test that the backend todo-go-v2 application is running from you local machine you can clone the [todo-application](https://github.com/aserto-demo/todo-application) but you will need to forwad the port from your minikube cluster to your local machine.

To forward the port of the todo-go-v2 backend deployment pod you will need to run:
```
kubectl --namespace default port-forward $TODO_POD_NAME 3001:3001
```

Navigate to the folder of the todo-application you have cloned and follow the instructions from the [README](https://github.com/aserto-demo/todo-application/blob/main/README.md).
