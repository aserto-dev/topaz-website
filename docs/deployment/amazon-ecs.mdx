# Run on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)

The following is an example task definition for running topaz on Amazon ECS using either Fargate or EC2 as a capacity provider.
This example includes an `init-config` container that is responsible for retrieving a topaz config file from
an S3 bucket before the `topaz` container starts up.

The [topaz config new](/docs/command-line-interface/topaz-cli/configuration) CLI command can be used to generate
your configuration file, then it should be uploaded to a bucket location that is accessible by the `init-config` container.

:::note Note
If you intend to access the topaz console from a browser, you need to edit the generated configuration file and:
1. Set the `fqdn` (fully-qualified domain name) field in all gateway services to the DNS name and port of the topaz instance.
2. Add your domain to the list of `allowed_origins` for all services.

The `fqdn` fields should be set to an `https://` url with the hostname of the topaz instance and the port on which the
gateway service is exposed.
For example, if you are running the topaz container with the `topaz.example.com` DNS name and the default ports, you
would set the `authorizer` service's gateway to `fqdn: https://topaz.example.com:8383` and the directory services's
(reader, writer, model, importer, exporter) gateways to `fqdn: https://topaz.example.com:9393`.

In addition, you would add your domain the `allowed_origins` list:
```yaml
allowed_origins:
- https://localhost
- https://localhost:*
- https://topaz.example.com
- https://topaz.example.com:*
```
:::

This example attaches an EBS volume to persist the configuration, certs, and directory database.  If it does not already exist
you may need to create
an [IAM ECS Infrastructure Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/infrastructure_IAM_role.html)
to allow ECS to provision EBS volumes.

## Certificates

By default, topaz generates its own self-signed TLS certificates if none are provided. Those certificates are not
trusted by browsers and prevent the topaz console from communicating with the service.
There are two ways around it:

### Trust the self-signed certificates

You can download the generated certificate from the topaz instance using a browser or from the terminal using `openssl`:

```shell
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect <topaz_hostname>:8383 </dev/null 2>/dev/null | \
	openssl x509 -text > topaz-gateway.crt
```

This downloads the certificate from the specified topaz instance address and saves it to a local file
named `topaz-gateway.crt`. You can then add the certificate to your system's trust store.

To download the gRPC certificate, replace the port number with 8282:

```shell
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect <topaz_hostname>:8282 </dev/null 2>/dev/null | \
	openssl x509 -text > topaz-grpc.crt
```

### Use your own certificates

You can issue your own certificates and mount them into the `/data/certs` directory in the topaz container.
There should be two certificates, one used for by the gRPC services and the other for REST.

You should have six files in total:

* `grpc.key`: private key for the gRPC services
* `grpc.crt`: public certificate for the gRPC services
* `grpc-ca.crt`: CA certificate for the gRPC services
* `gateway.key`: private key for the REST services
* `gateway.crt`: public certificate for the REST services
* `gateway-ca.crt`: CA certificate for the REST services



### Sample task definition for topaz on Amazon ECS
Using the ECS console, create a task definition with existing JSON.  You will need to modify the init container
environment variables in this task definition with credentials that can reach your configuration bucket as well as
executionRoleArn with a value appropriate for your account.

From here you can launch topaz by [creating a new service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/create-service-console-v2.html)
in your ECS cluster.
