# Introduction

An authorization policy (or simply, a **policy**) is expressed in a declarative language called
[rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/).

A policy can include one or more `rego` files, and one or more JSON data files.

A `rego` file has a `package` directive which sets the namespace for the rego file, and defines one or more decisions.

```rego
package sample.GET.api.orders

allowed {
  true
}
```

:::note
In the rego file above, the `package` name follows the Topaz convention:

`policy-root`.`HTTP method`.`HTTP route`
:::

## Decision

A _decision_ is an output from the evaluation of a _policy_. The policy above exports a
decision called `allowed`, and sets its value to `true`.

The policy below exports the same decision (`allowed`), has a default value of `false` for this
decision, and a rule that sets `allowed` to true only if the logged-in users's `department` attribute
is equal to `"Sales"`:

```rego
package sample.GET.api.orders

default allowed = false

allowed {
  input.user.attributes.department == "Sales"
}
```

## User context

In the policy above, we were able to use the `department` attribute to help compute the `allowed`
decision. This is an example of User context that is used in a policy. If you import your identities from your identity provider, any properties they contain about users will be available to your policy.

In addition, you can add properties on your objects in an extensible JSON property bag, and use thse properties in authorization decisions.

## Resource context

Policies can also use resource context in their evaluation process. If we added the allowed clause
below to our policy, and the caller included a resource context that contains `{ "id": "<the-user-id>" }`,
the policy would evaluate `allowed` to `true` if the user id and the resource id match.

```rego
allowed {
  input.user.id == input.resource.id
}
```

## Objects

To resolve the identity of an object that is stored in the directory, you can use the `ds.object` built-in. Objects are resolved based on their `key` attribute. For example, you would ideally save users with a useful key such as an email address, and then use that email address to resolve the user object.

```rego
user = ds.object(input.user.email)
```

## check_relation built-in

The `ds.check_relation` built-in allows you to query the Topaz directory for a relationship between an object an a subject. Once we resolve the object and the subject, we can use the `ds.check_relation` built-in to check if the object has a relationship with the subject.

```rego
allowed {
  user = ds.object(input.user.email)
  department = ds.object(input.resource.id)
  ds.check_relation({
    "subject": user.id,
    "object": ds.object({
      "key": input.resource.id,
      "type": "department"
    }).id,
    "relationship": "owner"
  })
}
```

## Permission built-in

Similar to the `ds.check_relation` built-in, the `ds.check_permission` built-in allows you to query the Topaz directory for a permission that is associated with a relationship between an object and a subject. Once we resolve the object and the subject, we can use the `ds.check_permission` built-in to check if the object has a permission with the subject.

```rego
allowed {
  ds.check_permission({
    "subject": input.user.id,
    "object": ds.object({
      "key": input.resource.id,
      "type": "department"
    }).id,
    "permission": "can-read"
  })
}
```

## Example policy

The policy below is a sample policy that will take advantage of the relation and permission built-ins to check if a user has permission to delete a department. It will also combine an ABAC rule with that will check if the user is a member of the "IT" department.

```rego
package sample.DELETE.api.departments

default allowed = false

allowed {
  input.user.properties.department == "IT"
}

allowed {
  ds.check_permission({
    "subject": input.user.id,
    "object": ds.object({
      "key": input.resource.id,
      "type": "department"
    }).id,
    "permission": "can-delete"
  })
}
```
