Once you've created a policy image, you'll need to configure Topaz to properly obtain it from your policy registry.

## Config file location

The location of the Topaz configuration and data files created using `topaz templates install` or `topaz config new` can be found by issuing the command `topaz config info config`.

```sh
% topaz config info config
{
  "topaz_certs_dir": "/Users/ogazitt/.local/share/topaz/certs",
  "topaz_cfg_dir": "/Users/ogazitt/.config/topaz/cfg",
  "topaz_db_dir": "/Users/ogazitt/.local/share/topaz/db",
  "topaz_dir": "/Users/ogazitt/.config/topaz",
  "topaz_tmpl_dir": "/Users/ogazitt/.local/share/topaz/tmpl"
}
```

:::tip
Unless you've set the `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `$XDG_DATA_HOME` variables, the `topaz_cfg_dir` should be set to `$HOME/.config/topaz/cfg` on all OS's. The data and template files default to `$HOME/.local/share/topaz/{db,tmpl}` on Linux and Mac, and to `$HOME\AppData\Local\{db,tmpl}` on Windows.
:::

By default, the config file will be named after your configuration name - e.g. `todo.yaml` for the Todo template.

When you edit this file, you'll find a section called `opa`:

```yaml
opa:
  instance_id: "-"
  graceful_shutdown_period_seconds: 2
  # max_plugin_wait_time_seconds: 30 set as default
  local_bundles:
    paths: []
    skip_verification: true
  config:
    services:
      ghcr:
        url: https://ghcr.io
        type: "oci"
        response_header_timeout_seconds: 5
    bundles:
      todo:
        service: ghcr
        resource: "ghcr.io/aserto-policies/policy-todo:3.0.0"
        persist: false
        config:
          polling:
            min_delay_seconds: 60
            max_delay_seconds: 120
```

You can change the resource to the custom policy image that you've created using the `policy build` / `policy push` lifecycle commands described [here](./lifecycle.mdx).

## Configuring private registries

The configuration snippet above refers to the `ghcr.io` registry, and provides unauthenticated access. Below you'll find instructions on how to configure OPA to obtain a policy image from a private / authenticated registry.

### GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

To access a private image from GHCR, you'll need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens), with at least the scopes `read:org` and `repo`. If you want to be able to use `policy push`, you'll also need `write:packages`.

You'll use the PAT in the `<TOKEN>` placeholder below:

```yaml
opa:
  config:
    services:
      ghcr:
        url: https://ghcr.io
        type: oci
        credentials:
          bearer:
            scheme: "Bearer"
            token: "<TOKEN>"
```

### Aserto Policy Container Registry (APCR)

To access a private image from APCR, you'll need to obtain your Aserto Policy Registry username and API key [here](https://docs.aserto.com/docs/overview/policy-lifecycle#policy-cli).

You'll use these in the `<username:APIkey>` placeholder below. Note that the `bundle` should reference the `service` you created (`apcr`), and that the `resource` should have the prefix `apcr.io`.

```yaml
opa:
  config:
    services:
      apcr:
        url: https://registry.prod.aserto.com
        type: oci
        credentials:
          bearer:
            scheme: "basic"
            token: "<username:APIkey>"
      bundles:
        todo:
          service: apcr
          resource: registry.prod.aserto.com/<username>/<policy-image>:<policy-tag>
```
