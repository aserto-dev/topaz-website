# Policy Lifecycle

## Policy

At the core of Topaz’s authorization model is an authorization policy, which we refer to simply as a **Policy**. Policies are authored in a textual language called [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/), defined as part of the [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (OPA) project in the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/).

Policies are treated just like application code or infrastructure-as-code - they can be stored as code in a git repository, or as an OCIv2 image in a policy repository like GitHub Container Registry, Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, or the Aserto Policy Registry.

## The policy lifecycle

Policies are **authored** using a text / code editor, **built** into an image, **published** to a repository hosted on a registry, **run** in the Topaz authorizer, and **consumed** by an application.

### Author

Policies are comprised of a collection of `.rego` files and `.json` files, which provide static data that can be part of the policy.

### Build, tag and publish Policy images

The set of source files that comprise a policy are built into a **Policy Image** using a set of tools that are modeled after the `docker` toolset. You can build and tag a policy just like you build and tag a docker image.

There are two paths for managing the lifecycle of a policy image:

1. Using the `policy` CLI to build, tag and push a policy image to a policy registry.
2. Using GitHub, a **build action** automatically builds a new version of a policy image when the source repository is **tagged** with a new tag.

### `policy` CLI

#### Login

```bash
echo $PAT | policy login -s <REGISTRY> -u <USERNAME> --password-stdin
```

For example, to login to the Github Container Registry, use the server name `ghcr.io`.
```bash
echo $GITHUB_PAT | policy login -s ghcr.io -u <username> --password-stdin
```

Note that the GITHUB_PAT must have the `repo` and `write:packages` scopes, as well as `read:org` for reading packages in other orgs, and `delete:packages` to be able to use `policy rm -r` to remove an image from a remote registry.

#### Create a policy

To create a sample policy, you can use the `policy templates apply` command:

```bash
policy templates apply policy-template
```

This will generate a minimal "hello world" policy, accompanied by the following output:

```bash
Processing template 'policy-template'

Generating files .

The template 'policy-template' was created successfully.
```

The generated directory structure should look like this:
```bash
tree -a .
.
├── README.md
└── src
    ├── .manifest
    └── policies
        └── hello-rego.rego

2 directories, 3 files
```

#### Build

To build a policy image, use the `policy build` command, with the directory containing the policy source (in the example above, `./src`). You can specify a tag using the `-t` option:

```bash
policy build ./src -t my-org/my-policy:v0.1.2
```

:::note Tip
If you get an error like `rego_type_error: undefined function ds.check_relation`, chances are you are building from a directory that does not contain a `.manifest` file that declares the Topaz built-ins.
:::

You can tag any image by using the `policy tag` command:

```bash
policy tag my-org/my-policy:v0.1.2 my-org/my-policy:latest
```

#### Publish

To publish a built policy image to the policy registry, use the `policy push` command:

```bash
policy push my-org/my-policy:v0.1.2
```

#### Pull

Using the `policy` CLI, you can pull a policy image from a Policy Repository just like you pull a docker image.

```bash
policy pull my-org/my-policy:v0.1.2
```

For a complete reference on the `policy` CLI, refer to the [policy CLI](/docs/command-line-interface/policy-cli/download.mdx) documentation.

### Run

To run Topaz with the policy image, you first need to ensure the Topaz configuration file contains a reference to the policy. You can do this via the `topaz configure` command:

```bash
topaz configure -d -r my-org/my-policy:v0.1.2 -n my-policy
```

To start Topaz interactively:

```bash
topaz run 
```

To start Topaz as a daemon:

```bash
topaz start 
```

#### Configuration

The configuration file contains an `opa` section that defines the container registry service from where the policy image is obtained. This may need to be changed to match your registry service. Refer to the [configuration](./configuration.mdx) section to learn how to match the configuration to your specific container registry service.

### Consume

An application that wants to authorize a user's access to a resource based on the policy can call the policy instance, passing it the policy, decision(s), user context, and resource context, and the policy instance will evaluate the policy with the provided inputs and returns the boolean value(s) of the requested decision(s), allowing the application to definitively check whether the user has access to the resource based on the given policy.

The [`authz.is`](/docs/authorizer-guide/is) API is the underlying mechanism for an application to call the policy instance to make a decision. The [language SDKs](/docs/software-development-kits/overview) provide higher-level abstractions for interacting with policy instances.
