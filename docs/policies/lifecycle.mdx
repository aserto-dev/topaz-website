# Policy Lifecycle

## Policy

At the core of Topazâ€™s authorization model is an authorization policy, which we refer to simply as a **Policy**. Policies are authored in a textual language called [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/), defined as part of the [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (OPA) project in the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/).

Policies are treated just like application code or infrastructure-as-code - they can be stored as code in a git repository, or as an OCIv2 image in a policy repository (like the [Open Policy Registry](https://www.openpolicyregistry.io/) or a commercial registry like GitHub Container Registry).

## The policy lifecycle

Policies are **authored** using a text / code editor, **built** into an image, **published** to a repository hosted on a registry, **run** in the Topaz authorizer, and **consumed** by an application.

### Author

Policies are comprised of a collection of `.rego` files and `.json` files, which provide static data that can be part of the policy.

### Build, tag and publish Policy images

The set of source files that comprise a policy are built into a **Policy Image** using a set of tools that are modeled after the `docker` toolset. You can build and tag a policy just like you build and tag a docker image.

There are two paths for managing the lifecycle of a policy image:

1. Using the `policy` CLI to build, tag and push a policy image to a policy registry.
2. Using GitHub, a **build action** automatically builds a new version of a policy image when the source repository is **tagged** with a new tag.

### `policy` CLI

#### Login

```bash
policy login -s <PATH-TO-REGISTRY> -u <USERNAME> -p <APCR_API_KEY>
```
{/* TODO: Opcr connection */}
To connect to the Open Policy Container Registry, use the path ``.

To connect to the Github Container Registry, use the path `ghcr.io`.
```bash
policy login -s ghcr.io -u <username>
```

#### Build

To build a policy image, use the `policy build` command. Then, tag your built image by using the `policy tag` command.

```bash
policy build . -t my-org/my-policy:v0.1.2
policy tag my-org/my-policy:v0.1.2 my-org/my-policy:latest
```

#### Publish

To publish a built policy image to the policy registry, use the `policy push` command:

```bash
policy push my-org/my-policy:v0.1.2
```

#### Pull

Using the `policy` CLI, you can pull a policy image from a Policy Repository just like you pull a docker image.

```bash
policy pull my-org/my-policy:v0.1.2
```

### Run
To run Topaz with the policy image, run the following command:
```
topaz run my-org/my-policy:v0.1.2
```

### Consume

An application that wants to authorize a user's access to a resource based on the policy can call the policy instance, passing it the policy, decision(s), user context, and resource context, and the policy instance will evaluate the policy with the provided inputs and returns the boolean value(s) of the requested decision(s), allowing the application to definitively check whether the user has access to the resource based on the given policy.

The [`authz.is`](/docs/authorizer-guide/is) API is the underlying mechanism for an application to call the policy instance to make a decision. The [language SDKs](/docs/software-development-kits/overview) provide higher-level abstractions for interacting with policy instances.
