# Directory

The Topaz Directory stores the information required to make authorization decisions.
It is flexible enough to support different access control strategies including Role-Based Access Control (RBAC),
Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), and Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC).

An authorization decision is an answer to the question *"Is subject __S__ allowed to perform action __A__ on resource __R__?"*
In other words, authorization decisions determine whether a subject (e.g. user, group, service) has a given permission
(e.g. read, write, delete) on a resource (e.g. document, folder, project, etc.).

## CLI docs

The `topaz` CLI contains a number of commands to manage the directory. Refer to the [CLI docs](/docs/command-line-interface/topaz-cli/directory.mdx) for more information.

## API docs

The Topaz directory supports both gRPC and REST APIs. Refer to the [API docs](./apis.mdx) for for information.

## Concepts

### Authorization Model
The authorization model specifies the [_object types_](#objects) that can participate in authorization decisions.
Each object type can have [_relations_](#relations) and [_permissions_](#permissions).

Relations can be thought of as the roles that an object type supports.
Permissions are the actions that can be performed on the object type, and are granted through relations.

For example, a `file` object type can define the `can_read`, `can_write`, and `can_delete` permissions,
and have these granted through the `owner`, `editor`, and `viewer` relations.

### Objects
Objects represent the participants in authorization decisions. In the context of an authorization decision one object
represents a _subject_&mdash;an actor who _performs_ an action&mdash;and another represents a _resource_&mdash;the
item that subject attempts to access.

Each object has a _type_ and the set of all available types is defined in the directory's [_manifest_](#manifest).
An object is uniquely identified by the combination of its type and a user-defined ID. For example, a `user` object
may have an email address as its ID.

IDs must be unique within a type, but objects of different types are allowed to have the same ID.

To support ABAC-style policies in which authorization decision are affected by attributes of the resource being accessed or the subject
performing the action (e.g. credit limit, date of birth, region), objects may include JSON _properties_ that are stored in the directory
and can be inspected by the authorizer when evaluating authorization requests.

In other cases, authorization decisions can be made purely based on [_relations_](#relations) between objects (e.g. _Michael_ is the
_owner_ of the _Sales_ folder) without any properties. Such objects don't need to be stored explicitly.
They can simply appear as pairs of object type and ID in one or more relations.


### Relations
A relation is a _labeled_ association between a resource (source object) and a subject (target object).
Each object type, defined in the directory's [manifest](#manifest), may specify the kinds of relations that can be
created from objects of that type, and the definition of each relation type indicates the types of objects that can
be used as the subjects of the relation.

For example, a `file` object type my define an `owner` relation that can take a `user` as its subject.

See the [Manifest Reference](directory/manifest-reference#relation-definitions) for more details about defining relations.


### Permissions
A permission represents a kind of action that a subject may perform on a resource.
Similar to relations, each permission is defined in the [manifest](#manifest) as part of an object type definition.

Unlike relations, permissions cannot be assigned explicitly. They are granted indirectly by combining relations and/or other
permissions using [permission operators](directory/manifest-reference#permission-definitions).

For example, if a `file` resource has `editor` and `viewer` relations, it can grant a `can_write` permission to anyone with
the `editor` relation to the resource, and a `can_read` permission to anyone who `can_write` or has the `viewer`
relation. The example [below](#manifest) illustrates this exact scenario.


### Manifest
The **manifest** is a yaml file that defines the authorization model. Here is a manifest for the example above:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://www.topaz.sh/schema/manifest.json
---
model:
  # version of the manifest file format.
  version: 3

types:
  user: {}

  file:
    relations:
      owner: user
      editor: user
      viewer: user
    permissions:
      can_delete: owner
      can_write:  can_delete | editor
      can_read:   can_edit   | viewer
```

* This manifest defines two types: `user` and `file`.
* The `user` type as no relations or permissions and can only used as a subject (target) of relations.
* The `file` type has three relations: `owner`, `editor`, and `viewer`. All three can only be assigned to subjects of type `user`.
* The `file` type has three permissions: `can_delete`, `can_write`, and `can_read`.
* The `can_delete` permission is granted to anyone who has the `owner` relation to the file.
* The `can_write` permission is granted to anyone with the `can_delete` permission on the file OR the `editor` relation to it.
* The `can_read` permission is granted to anyone with the `can_edit` permission OR the `viewer` relation to the file.


### Checking Permissions and Relations

The directory provides a convenient `Check` API to determine whether a subject has a given relation to or permission on a specified
resource. It simply takes:
* The type and ID of an object (the resource).
* The relation or permission to check.
* The type and ID of the subject.

The result of the call is a boolean value that indicates whether or not the subject has the specified relation or
permission on the resource.

## Example

With these building blocks, it's possible to construct expressions like:
* _Euan_ is a _member_ of the _Sales-group_
* _Sales-folder_ is a _parent_ of the _Sales-plan-document_
* _Sales-group_ is a _viewer_ of the _Sales-folder_
* The _viewer_ relation includes the _read_ permission

And answer queries like:
* Does _Euan_ have the _read_ permission on the _Sales-plan-document_ ?

The Topaz directory is able to evaluate this graph query, traversing through these relations and determining the outcome.

## Common Object Types

While Topaz does not have any hard-coded types, it does come with a few templates, including `simple-rbac`, `gdrive`, and others.
Each of these templates defines its own manifest, but these manifests share a set of common object types and relations:

* __User__: a principal (typically used as a subject)
* __Group__: a collection of users and/or other groups (can be used as a subject or object)
* __Identity__: a unique identifier for a user (e.g. email, PID)

These object types can be found in almost all identity providers.
Topaz templates define these common types to make it easy to model a few universal patterns:

* Groups are used to model collections of users, and can be nested.
  This makes it easy to model authorization rules that depend on (nested) group membership.
* Identities are used to look up users. This makes it easy to look up a user by any of their unique identifiers,
  including `email`, or the `sub` claim that an identity provider embeds in a JWT.

## User Context and Identity objects

Applications can provide an [identity context](/docs/authorizer-guide/identity-context) in an authorization request,
which is used to look up the user object associated with that identity.

For an identity context of type `IDENTITY_TYPE_JWT`, the Authorizer will load an `identity` object with the `id` that is found in the `sub` claim of the JWT.
For an identity context of type `IDENTITY_TYPE_SUB`, the string passed in will be used as the `id` of the identity object to load.

The Authorizer then looks up the `identifier` relation to the corresponding `user` object, and loads the user object,
making it available to the Policy as `input.user`.

In this way, a Policy can reference properties of the user using the expression `input.user.properties.<property_name>`.

## Built-ins

Authorization policies can access directory contents via a set of [built-ins](/docs/directory/built-ins).
