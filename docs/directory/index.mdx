# Directory

The Topaz Directory stores information required to make authorization decisions. It is flexible enough to easily
support different access control strategies including Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control
(ABAC), and Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC).

An authorization decision is an answer to the question *"Is subject __S__ allowed to perform action __A__ on resource __R__?"*
In other words, authorization decisions determine whether a subject (user, group, service, etc.) has a given permission on a resource
(document, folder, project, etc.).

## Concepts

The Topaz Directory helps to define policies that make authorization decisions through three main concepts:
* __Object__: Objects represent the participants in authorization decisions. Some objects represent __subjects__&mdash;actors who _perform_
  actions&mdash;and other may represent __resources__&mdash;the items that subjects can attempt to access in various ways.

* __Permission__: A kind of action that subjects may attempt to perform.

* __Relation__: A _labeled_ association between a source object and a target object, which may carry with it a set of
  _permissions_.

Using these concepts, an authorization decision can be rephrased as *"Does subject __S__ have a relation that carries
permission __P__ with resource __R__?"* A relation between a subject and a resource can be defined explicitly, or be implied from
group membership. For example, the subject __S__ may be a _member_ of group __G__, which in turn has a relation that
carries permission __P__ with the resource __R__.

### Directory as a Graph

It is convenient to think of the Topaz Directory as a graph in which objects are the nodes and relations the edges.
Under this model, the authorization question in the previous section can be rephrased again as *"Is there a path from
the node __S__ to the node __R__ in which one or more edges have permission __P__?"*

Indeed, the directory API provides methods to query and traverse this graph of objects and relations.

### Examples

With these building blocks, it's possible to construct expressions like:
* *Euan* is a *member* of the *Sales-group*
* *Sales-folder* is a *parent* of the *Sales-plan-document*
* *Sales-group* is a *viewer* of the *Sales-folder*
* The *viewer* relation includes the *read* permission

And answer queries like:
* Does *Euan* have the *read* permission on the *Sales-plan-document* ?

The Topaz directory is able to evaluate this graph query, traversing through these relationship and determining the outcome.

## Types

To help define different kinds of objects and specify the relations that may exist between them, the Topaz Directory
provides two extensible sets of types:
* __Object Types__ define the kinds of objects that can be created in the directory.
* __Relation Types__ define the kinds of relations that can be created between directory objects.


### Built-in Object Types

The Directory is pre-configured with a few types:
* **User**: a principal (used as a subject)
* **Group**: used to model a collection of users and/or other groups (can be used as a subject or object)
* **Identity**: an identifier for a User (e.g. email, PID)
* **Application**: an object that a User may have a relationship to
* **Resource**: a generic resource

### Built-in Relation Types

The following relation types are also pre-configured:


| Relation type | Object type | Description                         |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| Member        | Group       | A subject is a member of a group    |
| Identifier    | Identity    | A user is identified by an identity |
| User          | Application | A user can have applications        |
| Manager       | User        | A user has a manager                |


The Topaz Directory seeds User instances and Identity instances (and the relationships between them) from
any identity providers that has been [connected](/docs/overview/connections) to the control plane.  Some identity
providers also allow importing Group objects. All of these imported objects are available to Authorizer instances
for making authorization decisions.

### User-defined types

Object and relation types are extensible. Topaz makes it easy to create your own types
which model your resource hierarchy / domain model. For example, you may have Organizations, which may have Folders.
Topaz lets you create these object types in the directory, along with relation types (like Viewer, Editor, Admin, Owner)
which model the relationship between these objects and subject types (such as User or Group).

## User Context

Policies can reference [identity context](/docs/authorizer-guide/policy#identity-context). A calling application can
provide the [identity context](/docs/authorizer-guide/identity-context) which is used to load that identity context.

The Authorizer will resolve the user identity in the Directory. It will then load the user context and make it available to the Policy as `input.user`.

## Extensible properties

Each object has a JSON property bag that allows storing additional information for that object.

For example, the Topaz Directory stores a read-only replica of the user data it receives (and merges) from various
identity providers. Administrators and application developers can store custom attributes in the JSON property bag without
worrying about conflicts with the identity provider.

## Built-ins

Authorization policies can access directory contents via a set of [built-ins](/docs/authorizer-guide/built-ins).
