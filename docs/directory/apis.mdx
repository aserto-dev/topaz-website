# Directory APIs

The Directory APIs are currently only exposed over gRPC. They are organized into four services:
- [`aserto.directory.reader.v2.Reader`](/docs/directory/reader) - Reader APIs
- [`aserto.directory.writer.v2.Writer`](/docs/directory/writer) - Writer APIs
- `aserto.directory.importer.v2.Importer/Import` - import entities
- `aserto.directory.exporter.v2.Exporter/Export` - export entities

The Reader APIs and Writer APIs can be used to read and write data to the directory.

The Import and Export APIs can be used to stream data in and out of the directory.
