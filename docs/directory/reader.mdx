# Reader APIs

The Directory Reader APIs are in the `aserto.directory.reader.v3.Reader` service.

- `Check` - check whether a subject has a relation or permission to an object (combines the functionality of CheckPermission and CheckRelation)
- `CheckPermission` - check whether a subject has a permission (via a relation) on an object (deprecated, CheckPermission is superseded by Check)
- `CheckRelation` - check whether a subject has a relation to an object (deprecated, CheckRelation is superseded by Check)

- `GetObject` - get an object by `type` and `identifier`
- `GetObjectMany` - get a set of objects by `type` and `identifier`
- `GetObjects` - get all objects in the system that match a filter. This is a paginated interface.

- `GetRelation` - get a relation instance between the provided subject and object using the relation type.
- `GetRelations` - get all relations in the system that match a filter. This is a paginated interface.

- `GetGraph` - searches the graph to find all subjects of a given type with a specified relation to a given subject or vice versa, all objects of a given type that a specified subject has a given relation to.
