# Model APIs

The Directory Model APIs are in the `aserto.directory.model.v3.Model` service.

A *manifest* is a textual DSL that describes the domain model of the directory. It contains the definitions for all *object types*, including the *relations* and *permissions* defined for each.

- `GetManifest` - get the directory manifest
- `SetManifest` - sets the directory manifests
- `DeleteManifest` - deletes the directory manifest, along with any data in the directory

## Manifest

Learn about defining a manifest for a domain model [here](./define-domain-model.mdx).

A full annotated example of the manifest language can be found [here](./manifest-reference.mdx).
