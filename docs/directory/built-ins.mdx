# Built-in Functions

Topaz provides a set of built-in functions that can be used in your policy. These functions make it easier to leverage information found the Topaz directory.

### `ds.identity`
```js
ds.identity({
  "key": "<value>"
})
```
Looks up a user identity by one of the keys (e.g. email address or PID), and returns the `key` of the user object.

For example: `ds.identity({ "key": "euang@acmecorp.com" })` will return `dfdadc39-7335-404d-af66-c77cf13a15f8`.

### `ds.object`
```js
ds.object({
  "type": "<type>",
  "key": "<value>"
})
```
Returns an object instance of `<type>`, looked up by the key supplied as `<value>`.

For example: `ds.object({ "type": "identity", "key": "euang@acmecorp.com" })` will return the identity object associated with Euan.

### `ds.relation`

```js
ds.relation({
  "object_key": "<object-key>",
  "object_type": "<object-type>",
  "relation": "<relation-name>",
  "subject_key": "<subject-key>",
  "subject_type": "<subject-type>"
})
```
Returns the relation instance that connects the subject with the object through the relation identified by `<object-type>` and `<relation-name>`.

### `ds.check_relation`

```js
ds.check_relation({
  "object": {
    "key": "<object-key>",
    "type": "<object-type>"
  },
  "relation": {
    "name": "<relation-name>",
    "object_type": "<object-type>"
  },
  "subject": {
    "key": "<subject-key>",
    "type": "<subject-type>"
  }
})
```
An object is identified by the combination of its `<object-type>` and `<object-key>`. The same is true for a subject.

A relation type is uniquely identified by the object type name and the relation name. A relation instance of that type will relate an object instance to a subject instance.

`ds.check_relation` returns `true` if the object instance has a relation of the type specified to the subject instance.

### `ds.check_permission`

```js
ds.check_permission({
  "object": {
    "key": "<object-key>",
    "type": "<object-type>"
  },
  "permission": {
    "name": "<permission-name>",
  },
  "subject": {
    "key": "<subject-key>",
    "type": "<subject-type>"
  }
})
```
An object is identified by the combination of its `<object-type>` and `<object-key>`. The same is true for a subject.

`ds.check_permission` returns`true` if the subject has the permission `permission-name` referenced through one or more relations to the object.

### `ds.graph`

```js
ds.graph({
    "anchor": {
      "key": "<anchor-key>",
      "type": "<anchor-type>"
    },
    "object": {
      "key": "<object-key>",
      "type": "<object-type>"
    },
    "relation": {
      "name": "<relation-name>",
      "object_type": "<object-type>"
    },
    "subject": {
      "key": "<subject-key>",
      "type": "<subject-type>"
    }
})
```
Returns the graph of relations and objects that is anchored in `anchor-key`. All other arguments are optional and restrict the graph returned to specific subjects, objects, or relations. The graph will be traversed up until a maximum depth, to avoid infinite recursion through graph cycles.
