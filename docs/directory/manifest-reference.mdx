## Declare object types
types:

  # Declare the "user" object type
  # The annotation "display_name" acts as a hint to the Topaz UI for a display name for this type
  ### display_name: User ###
  user:
    # Declare relations that are supported by the user object type
    # The declaration below means that the target of the "manager" relation
    #   can only be an instance of a "user".
    relations:
      manager: user

  # Declare the "group" object type
  group:
    # Declare relations that are supported by this object type
    # Format: <relation_name>: <type> | <another_type> | <type#relation>
    relations:
      # The declaration below means that the target of the "member"
      #   relation can be an individual "user" OR the set of all members
      #   of another "group", resulting in nested groups.
      member: user | group#member

  # Declare the "folder" object type
  folder:
    # Declare relations that are supported on "folder"
    relations:
      # The "parent" relation defines a recursive parent relationship
      parent: folder
      owner: user | group#member
      editor: user | group#member
      # The "viewer" relation can be assigned to:
      #   1. An individual "user".
      #   2. All users (the wildcard id "*").
      #   3. All members of a given group.
      viewer: user | user:* | group#member

    # Declare permissions that are supported on "folder"
    permissions:
      can_delete_folder: owner | parent->can_delete_folder
      can_write_folder: can_delete_folder | parent->can_write_folder | editor
      # Format: <permission_name>: relation_or_permission1 | relation_or_permission2 | relation->relation_or_permission2
      # The declaration below means that the "can_read_folder" permission
      #   is granted to:
      #     1. anyone who can write to the folder (has the "can_write_folder" permission).
      #     2. anyhone who can write to the parent folder (parent->can_read_folder).
      #     3. anyone with the "viewer" relation to the folder.
      can_read_folder: can_write_folder | parent->can_read_folder | viewer

  # Declare the "document" object type
  document:
    relations:
      parent: folder
      owner: user | group#member
      editor: user | group#member
      viewer: user | group#member

    permissions:
      can_delete_document: owner | parent->can_delete_folder
      can_write_document: can_delete_document | parent->canwrite_document | editor
      can_read_document: can_write_document | parent->can_read_document | viewer
```

## Relation definitions

A relation definition specifies the set of valid assignments for the relation. Relation names must be unique within an object type.
The _object_ of the relation must be of the type in which the relation is defined and the subject must match one of the assignment
terms in the relation definition.

There are three kinds of assignment specifiers:

### Direct assignment

Direct assignment specify an object type that can be used as the subject of the relation. For example, the `manager`
relation below can be directly assigned to an object of type `user`:

```yaml
user:
  relations:
    manager: user  # direct assignment
```

That means that a `manager` relation can be created with a `user` object and a `user` subject.

### Wildcard assignment

In addition to a direct relation between two object, it is also possible to allow wildcard relations where the subject
is the set of all objects of the given type. For example, the `viewer` relation below can be created between a `document`
and a specific user (direct assignment) or between a document and _all_ users.

```yaml
document:
  relations:
    viewer: user | user:*
```

This definition allows the `viewer` relation to be created between a document and the user with ID `*`, which represents
all users.

### Subject Relations

In addition to direct and wildcard assignments, it is also possible to create relations to dynamically computed sets of
subjects. For example, the `editor` relation defined below on the `document` type can be directly assigned to a user OR
to everyone with the `member` relation to a specified `group`.

```yaml
group:
  relations:
    member: user

document:
  relations:
    editor: user | group#member
```

Unlike direct assignments, we not only specify the _type_ of subject (`group`) but also a _relation_ on that type
(`member`). In other words, we create an `editor` relation between a document and all users that have a `member`
relation with a given group.

Subject relations can also be used to defined nested sets. For example, we can modify the definition of `group` to be:

```yaml
group:
  relations:
    member: user | group#member
```

This allows us to create `member` relations between groups to indicate that all members of one group are also members of
another.


## Permission definitions

Permissions are similar to relations but instead of assigning them explicitly, they are defined by combining relations
or other permissions using _operators_. They can be thought of as implicitly-assigneed relations.

Topaz supports four operators for defining how permissions are granted through relations and/or other permissions.

### Union

The _union_ operator (`|`) indicates that a permission is granted through ANY of the listed relations or permissions.

Example:

```yaml
  can_read: can_write | viewer
```

This means that the `can_read` permission is granted to anyone who has the `can_write` permission OR is the subject of the `viewer` relation.

### Intersection

The _intersection_ operator (`&`) indicates that a permission is granted only if the target is part of ALL the listed relations/permissions.

Example:

```yaml
  can_comment: can_view & commenter
```

This means that the `can_comment` permission is granted only if the user has the `can_view` permission AND is also the subject of the `commenter` relation.

### Exclusion

The _exclusion_ operator (`-`) indicates that a permission is granted only if the target is NOT part of the specified relation/permission.

Example:

```yaml
  can_comment: commenter - guest
```

This means that the `can_comment` permission is granted to subjects that are commenters and are NOT guests.

### Arrow

The _arrow_ operator (`->`) allows a permission to be granted to subjects who have a specified relation or permission with another object that is
related to the object on which the permission is defined.

Example:

```yaml
  types:
    folder:
      relations:
        parent: folder
        owner: user | group#member
      permissions:
        can_delete_folder: owner | parent->can_delete_folder

    document:
      relations:
        parent: folder
        owner: user | group#member
      permissions:
        can_delete_document: owner | parent->can_delete_folder
```

In the above example, `document` and `folder` types both have a `parent` relation to a `folder`.

The `can_delete_folder` permission can be granted by assigning a subject directly as the `owner` of a `folder`, OR if that subject has the `can_delete_folder` permission on any `folder` in the `parent` relation chain.

Likewise, the `can_delete_document` permission can be granted by assigning a subject directly as the `owner` of a `document`, OR if that subject has a `can_delete_folder` permission on a  `folder` in the `parent` relation chain.

Arrow operators are integral to defining hierarchical permissions.
