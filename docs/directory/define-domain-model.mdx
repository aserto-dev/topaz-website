# Defining a domain model

The authorization model needs to mirror the domain model used by the application. To populate the directory we need to define the domain model which is comprised of objects and relations. To define these objects and relations, we first need to declare object types and relation types.

## Object types

Object types define the entities in the system, such as `user`, `department`, `task`, etc. Some object types can be designated as _subjects_. This means they can function as the target of a relation. For example, a `user` is a subject, and a `task` is an object. A `group` can function as an _object_ when defining a _member_ relation to a user (_subject_), or it can function as a _subject_ when defining an _owner_ relation to a task (_object_).

## Relation types

Relation types define the relationships between entities, such as `member`, `owner`, `manager`, etc. Relation types are defined on object types. In the context of authorization, we can think of relation types as roles that can be assigned to subjects. For example, a `user` can be assigned the `owner` role for a `department`. In our policy, we can check whether a relation exists for a `subject` and an `object` using the `ds.check_relation` built-in.

## Permissions

While relations are helpful to model roles, we can associate many permissions to a single role. In the directory, permissions are associated with relation types. For example, we can define the `owner` relation type as associated with the `can_create`, `can_delete`, and `can_view` _permissions_. In our policy, we can check whether a permission exists between a `subject` and an `object` using the `ds.check_permission` built-in.

## Defining the domain model

Create a `manifest.yaml` to define object types, relation types and permission. For example:

```yaml
# object type (document)
document:
  # object relation (document:owner)
  admin:
    # include permissions of other object relations on the same object type
    union:
    - editor
    - viewer
    # permissions for relation on object type
    permissions:
    - sample.document.delete

  # object relation (document:editor)
  editor:
    # include permissions of other object relations on the same object type
    union:
    - viewer
    # permissions for relation on object type
    permissions:
    - sample.document.create
    - sample.document.update

  # object relation (document:viewer)
  viewer:
    # permissions for relation on object type
    permissions:
    - sample.document.read
```

Load the `manifest.yaml` file into Topaz by running:

```
topaz load manifest.yaml
```
