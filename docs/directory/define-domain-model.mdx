# Defining a domain model

The authorization model needs to mirror the domain model used by the application. To populate the directory we need to define the domain model which is comprised of objects and relations. To define these objects and relations, we first need to declare object types, and their relations and permissions.

## Object types

Object types define the entities in the system, such as `user`, `department`, `document`, etc. Any declared object type can also be designated as a _subject_ of a relationship, by specifying it as the _target_ of a relation.

For example:
* `document` can be defined an object type.
* `user` object type is typically used as a subject of a relation.
* `group` can function as an _object_ when defining a _member_ relation to a user (_subject_), or it can function as a _subject_ when defining an _owner_ relation to a document (_object_).

## Relations

Relations define the relationships between entities, such as `member`, `owner`, `manager`, etc. Relations are defined on object types. In the context of authorization, we can think of relations as roles that can be assigned to subjects. For example, a `user` can be assigned the `owner` role for a `document`. In our policy, we can check whether a relation exists for a `subject` and an `object` using the `ds.check` built-in.

## Permissions

While relations are helpful to model roles, we can associate many permissions to a single role. In the directory, permissions are associated with relations. For example, we can declare that the `owner` relation confers the `can_read`, `can_write`, and `can_delete` _permissions_. In our policy, we can check whether a permission exists between a `subject` and an `object` using the `ds.check` built-in.

## Defining the domain model

Create a `manifest.yaml` to define object types, relations, and permission. For example:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://www.topaz.sh/schema/manifest.json
---

model:
  version: 3

types:
  ### display_name: User ###
  user:
    relations:
      manager: user

  ### display_name: Identity ###
  identity:
    relations:
      identifier: user

  ### display_name: Group ###
  group:
    relations:
      member: user | group#member

  ### display_name: Document ###
  document:
    relations:
      owner: user | group#member
      editor: user | group#member
      viewer: user | group#member

    permissions:
      can_delete: owner
      can_write: editor | can_delete
      can_read: viewer | can_write
```

In this manifest, we define four object types: `user`, `identity`, `group`, and `document`.

* The `user` object type defines a `manager` relation, whose target can only be another user. This makes it easy to model management hierarchies using Topaz.
* The `identity` object type allows creating (or importing from an IDP) multiple identities associated with a `user` object.
* The `group` object type defines a `member` relation, whose target can be a `user`, or the set of users that have a `member` relationship from another `group` object.
  This is designated by the notation `group#member`. For example, if you define a group with an ID of `editors`, you can add individual users to it, and you could also add the `member`'s of the `viewers` group by adding that group object to the `editors` group.
* The `document` object type defines the `owner`, `editor`, and `viewer` relations, which can have subjects (targets) of either type `user` or `group`. In the case of a group, the set of instances in the `member` relation of that group become part of the set referred to by the relation.
* The `document` object type also defines the `can_read`, `can_write`, and `can_delete` permissions. These permissions are granted through the relations we just defined. Note that permission definitions can use a few **operators**: union (`|`), intersection (`&`), exclusion (`-`), and the arrow operator (`->`).

## Loading the manifest

Load the `manifest.yaml` file into Topaz by running:

```sh
topaz directory set manifest ./manifest.yaml -i
```
