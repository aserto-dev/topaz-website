# Overview

The Authorizer uses the
[Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org) (OPA) to
compute a [**decision**](/docs/policies/index.mdx#decision) based on a [**policy**](/docs/policies/index.mdx),
[**user context**](/docs/policies/index.mdx#user-context), and **data**.

An application can interact with the Authorizer through a set of gRPC or HTTPS REST APIs.

The Topaz authorizer is [deployed as a sidecar (or as a local service)](/docs/deployment/index.mdx), right next to your application.

## Authorizer API categories

The Authorizer provides the following APIs to calling applications.

- [Authorization](/docs/authorizer-guide/authz) (`authz`) - perform authorization queries
- [Policies](/docs/authorizer-guide/policies) (`policies`) - return information about loaded policies
- Information (`info`) - return build information

The REST APIs are all exposed with the `/api/v2` URL prefix. By default, the Topaz REST APIs are hosted on `https://localhost:8383`. For example, the `policies` REST API can be called in the following way:

```shell
curl -k https://localhost:8383/api/v2/policies
```

By default, the gRPC APIs are hosted on `localhost:8282`. `grpcui` represents a convenient way to browse the gRPC APIs:

```shell
brew install grpcui

grpcui --insecure localhost:8282
```
