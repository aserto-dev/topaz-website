# Overview

The Authorizer uses the
[Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org) (OPA) to
compute a [**decision**](/docs/policies/index#decision) based on a [**policy**](/docs/policies/index),
[**user context**](/docs/policies/index#user-context), and **data**.

An application can interact with the Authorizer through a set of gRPC or HTTPS REST APIs.

The Topaz authorizer is [deployed as a sidecar (or as a local service)](/docs/deployment/index), right next to your application.

## Authorizer API categories

The Authorizer provides the following APIs to calling applications:

- [Authorization](/docs/authorizer-guide/authz) (`authz`)
- [Directory](/docs/directory/index) (`dir`)
