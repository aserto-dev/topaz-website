# Overview

Topaz is meant to be [deployed as a sidecar (or as a local service)](/docs/deployment/index.mdx), right next to your application. The application can use Topaz to externalize its authorization decisions.

The Topaz authorizer uses the [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org) (OPA) to compute a [**decision**](/docs/policies/index.mdx#decision) based on a [**policy**](/docs/policies/index.mdx),
[**user context**](/docs/policies/index.mdx#user-context), and **data** stored in the Topaz [directory](/docs/directory/index.mdx).

An application can interact with the Authorizer through a set of gRPC or HTTPS REST APIs.

A Topaz user can also interact with the authorizer through the [topaz authorizer](/docs/command-line-interface/topaz-cli/authorizer.mdx) commands.

## Authorizer API categories

The Authorizer provides the following APIs to calling applications.

- [Authorization](/docs/authorizer-guide/authz) (`authz`) - perform authorization queries
- [Policies](/docs/authorizer-guide/policies) (`policies`) - return information about loaded policies
- Information (`info`) - return build information

### REST APIs

The REST APIs are all exposed with the `/api/v2` URL prefix. By default, the Topaz REST APIs are hosted on `https://localhost:8383`. For example, the `policies` REST API can be called in the following way:

```shell
curl -k https://localhost:8383/api/v2/policies
```

The Authorizer REST APIs are documented [here](https://aserto.readme.io/reference/authorizeris-1).

### gRPC APIs
By default, the gRPC APIs are hosted on `localhost:8282`. `grpcui` represents a convenient way to browse the gRPC APIs:

```shell
brew install grpcui

grpcui --insecure localhost:8282
```

The Authorizer gRPC APIs are documented [here](https://buf.build/aserto-dev/authorizer/docs/main:aserto.authorizer.v2#aserto.authorizer.v2.Authorizer).
