# Display State Map

A common problem for SaaS front-ends is to conditionally display UI elements based on the set of permissions
that the logged-in user possesses. For example, if a user only has "viewer" permissions,
the front-end typically wants to avoid displaying UI elements that allow users to edit or update resources.

Topaz addresses this problem by defining the **display state map** pattern. An authorization policy
defines [decisions](/docs/policies/index#decision) called `visible` and `enabled`, which take on `true` / `false`
values when evaluated against the roles and attributes of the logged-in user. We refer to the following
type of JSON map as a **display state**:

```json
{ "visible": true, "enabled": false }
```

Topaz's [`decisiontree`](/docs/authorizer-guide/decisiontree) API makes it possible to compute these _display states_
for **every route or permission in your application** based on the roles and attributes of the logged-in
user. We call this map of maps a **display state map** and it looks like this:

```json
{
  "GET/api/users": { "visible": true, "enabled": true },
  "POST/api/users": { "visible": true, "enabled": false },
  ...
}
```

## SDK Usage

The Topaz [JavaScript SPA SDK](/docs/software-development-kits/javascript/spa) and
[React.js SDK](/docs/software-development-kits/javascript/react) support this pattern. Each of these SDKs works together
with other high-level language SDKs like the
[Express.js](/docs/software-development-kits/javascript/express#displaystatemap-middleware) middleware to allow retrieving this
**display state map** when the user logs in (and/or reload it). This in turn can be used to instruct
the UI on whether to render specific UI elements that correspond to these routes / permissions.
