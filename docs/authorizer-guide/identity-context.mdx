# Identity Context

When an Authorizer evaluates a policy, it receives an Identity Context from the calling application.
The `type` property of that Identity Context instructs the Authorizer how to identify the user:

- `IDENTITY_TYPE_NONE`: the policy is evaluated without a user context (`input.user` is empty)
- `IDENTITY_TYPE_SUB`: the user context is passed in as an OAuth subject
- `IDENTITY_TYPE_JWT`: the user context is passed in as a JWT access token

## Passing a user identity

In the `IDENTITY_TYPE_SUB` and `IDENTITY_TYPE_JWT` cases, the Authorizer will treat the `identity` string as a
OAuth subject or a JWT access, respectively. In the case of a JWT access token, the Authorizer will extract the `sub` (subject) claim, whereas
`IDENTITY_TYPE_SUB` indicates that the `identity` string already contains a subject.

Once the Authorizer has obtained the subject, it will use it as a key and look up the user in its
local directory instance (known as the Edge Directory Service, or EDS). It will then load the user
object identified by the identity context and make it available to the Policy as `input.user`.

For a user-facing API (for example, a back-end REST API that requires a JSON Web Token (JWT)
in the `Authorization` header), the caller will often extract the `sub` claim from the JWT and use it
in the `identity` field. That said, the `identity` can be any key that is used by the Identity Provider
to identify the user.

## Setting the Identity Context

The `is`, `query`, and `decisiontree` API calls all take an `identityContext` map:

`POST .../api/v2/authz/is`

```json
{
  "identityContext": {
    "identity": "[topaz-user-guid]",
    "type": "IDENTITY_TYPE_SUB"
  }, ...
}
```

To access the properties of the user in a policy, you can use `input.user`:

```rego
package sample.GET.api.orders
default allowed = false

# only allow salespeople
allowed {
  input.user.attributes.properties.department == "Sales"
}
```

## Using other JWT claims in a policy

Note that the `identityContext` is available as `input.identity`. If the policy wants to
extract additional claims out of a JWT and use them in the policy, it can readily do so.

Assuming the following `identityContext`:

`POST .../api/v2/authz/is`

```json
{
  "identityContext": {
    "identity": "[JWT that could contain a 'manager' claim]",
    "type": "IDENTITY_TYPE_JWT"
  }, ...
}
```

The following policy will extract the JWT using the `io.jwt.decode()` Rego built-in, make it available
as `token.payload`, and use claims in the payload within the policy:

```rego
package sample.GET.api.orders
default allowed = false

# Helper to get the token payload
token = {"payload": payload} {
  [header, payload, signature] := io.jwt.decode(input.identity.identity)
}

# only allow sales managers
allowed {
  input.user.attributes.properties.department == "Sales"
  token.payload.manager
}
```
